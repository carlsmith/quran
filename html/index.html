<span class=verse id=s2v1 title="Surah 2, Verse 1">ALM.</span>
<span class=verse id=s2v2 title="Surah 2, Verse 2">This is the Book in which there is no doubt, a guide for the righteous.</span>
<span class=verse id=s2v3 title="Surah 2, Verse 3">Those who believe in the unseen, and hold the contact prayer, and from Our provisions to them they spend.</span>
<span class=verse id=s2v4 title="Surah 2, Verse 4">And those who believe in what was sent down to you, and what was sent down before you, and regarding the Hereafter they are certain.</span>
<span class=verse id=s2v5 title="Surah 2, Verse 5">These are the ones guided by their Lord, and these are the successful ones.</span>
<span class=verse id=s2v6 title="Surah 2, Verse 6">As for those who reject, whether you warn them or do not warn them, they will not believe.</span>
<span class=verse id=s2v7 title="Surah 2, Verse 7">God has sealed their hearts and their ears, and over their eyes are covers. They will incur a great retribution.</span>
<span class=verse id=s2v8 title="Surah 2, Verse 8">And from the people are those who say: "We believe in God and in the Last Day," but they are not believers.</span>
<span class=verse id=s2v9 title="Surah 2, Verse 9">They seek to deceive God and those who believe, but they only deceive themselves without noticing.</span>
<span class=verse id=s2v10 title="Surah 2, Verse 10">In their hearts is a disease, so God increases their disease, and they will have a painful retribution for what they have denied.</span>
<span class=verse id=s2v11 title="Surah 2, Verse 11">And if they are told: "Do not make corruption in the land," they say: "But we are reformers!"</span>
<span class=verse id=s2v12 title="Surah 2, Verse 12">No, they are the corruptors, but they do not perceive.</span>
<span class=verse id=s2v13 title="Surah 2, Verse 13">And if they are told: "Believe, as the people have believed," they say: "Shall we believe like the foolish have believed?" No, they are the foolish but they do not know.</span>
<span class=verse id=s2v14 title="Surah 2, Verse 14">And if they come across those who have believed, they say: "We believe," and when they are alone with their devils they say: "We are with you, we were only mocking."</span>
<span class=verse id=s2v15 title="Surah 2, Verse 15">God mocks them, and leaves them prolonged in their transgression.</span>
<span class=verse id=s2v16 title="Surah 2, Verse 16">These are the ones who have purchased straying with guidance; their trade did not profit them, nor were they guided.</span>
<span class=verse id=s2v17 title="Surah 2, Verse 17">Their example is like the one who lights a fire, so when it illuminates what is around him, God takes away his light and leaves him in the darkness not seeing.</span>
<span class=verse id=s2v18 title="Surah 2, Verse 18">Deaf, dumb, and blind, they will not return.</span>
<span class=verse id=s2v19 title="Surah 2, Verse 19">Or like a storm from the sky, in it is darkness and thunder and lightning. They place their fingers in their ears from the thunderbolts for fear of death; and God is aware of the rejecters.</span>
<span class=verse id=s2v20 title="Surah 2, Verse 20">The lightning nearly snatches their sight, whenever it lights the path they walk in it, and when it becomes dark for them they stand. Had God willed, He would have taken their hearing and their sight; God is capable of all things.</span>
<span class=verse id=s2v21 title="Surah 2, Verse 21">O people, serve your Lord who has created you and those before you that you may be righteous.</span>
<span class=verse id=s2v22 title="Surah 2, Verse 22">The One who has made the earth a resting place, and the sky a shelter, and He sent down from the sky water with which He brought out fruits as a gift to you. So do not set up any equals with God while you know.</span>
<span class=verse id=s2v23 title="Surah 2, Verse 23">And if you are in doubt as to what We have sent down to Our servant, then bring a Chapter like this, and call upon your witnesses other than God if you are truthful.</span>
<span class=verse id=s2v24 title="Surah 2, Verse 24">And if you cannot do this; and you will not be able to do this; then beware the Fire whose fuel is people and stones, it has been prepared for the rejecters.</span>
<span class=verse id=s2v25 title="Surah 2, Verse 25">And give good news to those who believe and do good works that they will have estates with rivers flowing beneath them. Every time they receive a provision of its fruit, they say: "This is what we have been provisioned before," and they are given its likeness. And there they will have pure mates, and in it they will abide.</span>
<span class=verse id=s2v26 title="Surah 2, Verse 26">God does not shy away from putting forth the example of a mosquito, or anything above it. As for those who believe, they know that it is the truth from their Lord. As for the rejecters, they say: "What does God intend with this example?" He strays many by it, and He guides many by it; but He only strays by it the wicked.</span>
<span class=verse id=s2v27 title="Surah 2, Verse 27">The ones who break the pledge to God after making its covenant, and they sever what God had ordered to be delivered, and they make corruption on the earth; these are the losers.</span>
<span class=verse id=s2v28 title="Surah 2, Verse 28">How can you reject God when you were dead and He brought you to life? Then He makes you die, then He brings you to life, then to Him you return.</span>
<span class=verse id=s2v29 title="Surah 2, Verse 29">He is the One who has created for you all that is on the earth, then He attended to the heaven and has made it seven heavens, and He is aware of all things.</span>
<span class=verse id=s2v30 title="Surah 2, Verse 30">And your Lord said to the angels: "I am placing a successor on the earth." They said: "Will You place in it he who would make corruption in it, and spill blood; while we praise by Your glory, and exalt to You?" He said: "I know what you do not know."</span>
<span class=verse id=s2v31 title="Surah 2, Verse 31">And He taught Adam the names of all things, then He displayed them to the angels and said: "Inform Me of the names of these if you are truthful."</span>
<span class=verse id=s2v32 title="Surah 2, Verse 32">They said: "Glory to You, we have no knowledge except that which You have taught us, You are the Knowledgeable, the Wise."</span>
<span class=verse id=s2v33 title="Surah 2, Verse 33">He said: "O Adam, inform them of their names," so when he informed them of their names, He said: "Did I not tell you that I know the unseen of the heavens and the earth, and that I know what you reveal and what you are hiding?"</span>
<span class=verse id=s2v34 title="Surah 2, Verse 34">And We said to the angels: "Yield to Adam," so they yielded except for Satan, he refused and became arrogant, and became of the rejecters.</span>
<span class=verse id=s2v35 title="Surah 2, Verse 35">And We said: "O Adam, reside you and your mate in the paradise, and eat from it bountifully as you both wish, and do not come near this tree, else you will be of those who have wronged."</span>
<span class=verse id=s2v36 title="Surah 2, Verse 36">So, the devil caused them to slip from it, and he brought them out from what they were in, and We said: "Descend; for you are enemies to one another; and on the earth you will have residence and provisions until the appointed time."</span>
<span class=verse id=s2v37 title="Surah 2, Verse 37">Adam then received words from His Lord, so He forgave him; He is the Forgiver, the Merciful.</span>
<span class=verse id=s2v38 title="Surah 2, Verse 38">We said: "Descend from it all of you, so when the guidance comes from Me, then whoever follows My guidance, they will have nothing to fear, nor will they grieve."</span>
<span class=verse id=s2v39 title="Surah 2, Verse 39">And those who disbelieve and deny Our revelations, they are the dwellers of Hell, in it they will abide.</span>
<span class=verse id=s2v40 title="Surah 2, Verse 40">O Children of Israel, remember My blessings that I had blessed you with, and fulfill your pledge to Me that I may fulfill My pledge to you, and reverence Me alone.</span>
<span class=verse id=s2v41 title="Surah 2, Verse 41">And believe in what I have sent down, affirming what is with you, and do not be the first to disbelieve in it! And do not purchase with My revelations a cheap gain, and of Me you shall be aware.</span>
<span class=verse id=s2v42 title="Surah 2, Verse 42">And do not confound the truth with falsehood, nor keep the truth secret while you know.</span>
<span class=verse id=s2v43 title="Surah 2, Verse 43">And hold the contact prayer, and contribute towards purification, and kneel with those who kneel.</span>
<span class=verse id=s2v44 title="Surah 2, Verse 44">Do you exhort the people to do good, but forget yourselves, while you are reciting the Book? Do you not comprehend?</span>
<span class=verse id=s2v45 title="Surah 2, Verse 45">And seek help through patience and through the contact prayer. It is a difficult thing, but not so for the humble.</span>
<span class=verse id=s2v46 title="Surah 2, Verse 46">The ones who conceive that they will meet their Lord and that to Him they will return.</span>
<span class=verse id=s2v47 title="Surah 2, Verse 47">O Children of Israel, remember My blessings that I had blessed you with, and that I had preferred you over all the worlds.</span>
<span class=verse id=s2v48 title="Surah 2, Verse 48">And beware of a Day when no soul can avail another soul, nor will any intercession be accepted from it, nor will any ransom be taken, nor will they have supporters.</span>
<span class=verse id=s2v49 title="Surah 2, Verse 49">And We saved you from the people of Pharaoh, they were afflicting you with the worst punishment; they used to slaughter your children, and rape your women. In that was a great test from your Lord.</span>
<span class=verse id=s2v50 title="Surah 2, Verse 50">And We parted the sea for you, thus We saved you and drowned the people of Pharaoh while you were watching.</span>
<span class=verse id=s2v51 title="Surah 2, Verse 51">And We appointed a meeting time for Moses of forty nights, but then you took the calf after him while you were wicked.</span>
<span class=verse id=s2v52 title="Surah 2, Verse 52">Then We forgave you after that, perhaps you would be thankful.</span>
<span class=verse id=s2v53 title="Surah 2, Verse 53">And We gave Moses the Book and the criterion, perhaps you would be guided.</span>
<span class=verse id=s2v54 title="Surah 2, Verse 54">And Moses said to his people: "O my people, you have wronged your souls by taking the calf, so repent to your Maker, and kill yourselves. That is better for you with your Maker, so He would forgive you. He is the Forgiving, the Merciful."</span>
<span class=verse id=s2v55 title="Surah 2, Verse 55">And you said: "O Moses, we will not believe you until we see God openly!" So the thunderbolt took you while you were still staring.</span>
<span class=verse id=s2v56 title="Surah 2, Verse 56">Then We resurrected you after your death that you may be thankful.</span>
<span class=verse id=s2v57 title="Surah 2, Verse 57">And We shaded you with clouds, and sent down to you manna and quails: "Eat from the goodness of the provisions We have provided you." They did not wrong Us, but it was their souls that they wronged.</span>
<span class=verse id=s2v58 title="Surah 2, Verse 58">And We said: "Enter this town, and eat from it as you wish bountifully. And enter the passageway by crouching, and say: "Our load is removed," so that your wrongdoings will be forgiven, and We will increase for the good doers."</span>
<span class=verse id=s2v59 title="Surah 2, Verse 59">But the wicked altered what was said to them to a different saying, thus We sent down upon the wicked an affliction from the heavens for what wickedness they were in.</span>
<span class=verse id=s2v60 title="Surah 2, Verse 60">And Moses was seeking water for his people, so We said: "Strike the stone with your staff." Thus twelve springs exploded out of it; each people then knew from where to drink. "Eat and drink from the provisions of God, and do not roam the earth as corrupters."</span>
<span class=verse id=s2v61 title="Surah 2, Verse 61">And you said: "O Moses, we will not be patient to one type of food, so call for us your Lord that He may bring forth what the earth grows of its beans, cucumbers, garlic, lentils, and onions." He said: "Would you trade that which is lowly with that which is good?" Descend Egypt, you will have in it what you have asked for. And they were stricken with humiliation and disgrace, and they remained under the wrath of God for they were disbelieving in the revelations of God, and killing the prophets without right; this is for what they have disobeyed and transgressed.</span>
<span class=verse id=s2v62 title="Surah 2, Verse 62">Surely those who believe; and those who are Jewish, and the Nazarenes, and the Sabians, whoever of them believes in God and the Last Day and does good works; they will have their recompense with their Lord, and there is no fear upon them, nor will they grieve.</span>
<span class=verse id=s2v63 title="Surah 2, Verse 63">And We took your covenant, and raised the mount above you: "Take what We have given you with strength, and remember what is in it that you may be righteous."</span>
<span class=verse id=s2v64 title="Surah 2, Verse 64">Then you turned away after this. And had it not been for the grace of God upon you and His mercy, you would have been of the losers.</span>
<span class=verse id=s2v65 title="Surah 2, Verse 65">You have come to know who it was among you that transgressed the Sabbath, We said to them: "Be despicable apes!"</span>
<span class=verse id=s2v66 title="Surah 2, Verse 66">So it was that We made it into an example for what had happened in it and also what had passed, and a reminder to the righteous.</span>
<span class=verse id=s2v67 title="Surah 2, Verse 67">And Moses said to his people: "God orders you to slaughter a heifer." They said: "Do you mock us?" He said: "I seek refuge with God that I not be of the ignorant ones."</span>
<span class=verse id=s2v68 title="Surah 2, Verse 68">They said: "Call upon your Lord for us that He may clarify which it is." He said: "He says it is a heifer neither too old nor too young, an age between that. So now do as you are commanded."</span>
<span class=verse id=s2v69 title="Surah 2, Verse 69">They said: "Call upon your Lord for us that He may clarify what color it is." He said: "He says it is a yellow heifer with a strong color, pleasing to those who see it."</span>
<span class=verse id=s2v70 title="Surah 2, Verse 70">They said: "Call upon your Lord for us that He may clarify which one it is, for the heifers all look alike to us and we will, God willing, be guided."</span>
<span class=verse id=s2v71 title="Surah 2, Verse 71">He said: "He says it is a heifer which was never subjugated to plough the land, or water the crops, free from any blemish." They said: "Now you have come with the truth." And they slaughtered it, though they had nearly not done so.</span>
<span class=verse id=s2v72 title="Surah 2, Verse 72">And you had murdered a person, then disputed in the matter; God was to bring out what you were keeping secret.</span>
<span class=verse id=s2v73 title="Surah 2, Verse 73">We said: "Strike him with parts from it." It is thus that God brings the dead to life, and He shows you His signs that you may comprehend.</span>
<span class=verse id=s2v74 title="Surah 2, Verse 74">Then your hearts became hardened after that, they became like stone or even harder; but even from stone there are rivers that burst forth, and from them are those that crack so that the water comes forth, and from them are what descends from concern towards God; and God is not unaware of what you do.</span>
<span class=verse id=s2v75 title="Surah 2, Verse 75">Did you expect that they would believe with you, when a group of them had heard the words of God then altered them knowingly after having understood?</span>
<span class=verse id=s2v76 title="Surah 2, Verse 76">And when they come across those who believe, they say: "We believe!" And when they are alone with each other they say: "Why do you inform them of what God has said to us? Then they would use it in argument against us at your Lord. Do you not comprehend?"</span>
<span class=verse id=s2v77 title="Surah 2, Verse 77">Do they not know that God knows what they conceal and what they declare?</span>
<span class=verse id=s2v78 title="Surah 2, Verse 78">And among them are Gentiles who do not know the Book except by hearsay, and they only conjecture.</span>
<span class=verse id=s2v79 title="Surah 2, Verse 79">So woe to those who write the Book with their hands then say: "This is from God," so that they can purchase with it a cheap price! Woe to them for what their hands have written and woe to them for what they gained.</span>
<span class=verse id=s2v80 title="Surah 2, Verse 80">And they said: "The Fire will not touch us except for a number of days." Say: "Have you taken a pledge with God? If so, then God will not break His pledge. Or do you say about God what you do not know?"</span>
<span class=verse id=s2v81 title="Surah 2, Verse 81">Indeed, whoever gains a sin, and is surrounded by his mistakes; those are the people of the Fire, in it they will abide.</span>
<span class=verse id=s2v82 title="Surah 2, Verse 82">And those who believe and do good works, they are the people of Paradise, in it they will abide.</span>
<span class=verse id=s2v83 title="Surah 2, Verse 83">And We took the covenant of the Children of Israel: "You shall not serve except God, and do good to your parents, and regard the relatives, and the orphans, and the needy, and say kind things to the people, and hold the contact prayer, and contribute towards purification." But then you turned away, except for a few of you; you were objecting.</span>
<span class=verse id=s2v84 title="Surah 2, Verse 84">And We have taken a covenant with you: "You shall not spill the blood of each other, nor expel each other from your homes." And you agreed to this while bearing witness.</span>
<span class=verse id=s2v85 title="Surah 2, Verse 85">But then here you are killing each other and expelling a group of you from their homes; you act towards them with evil and animosity. And if they come to you as prisoners, you ransom them while it was unlawful for you to expel them! Do you believe in part of the Book and disbelieve in part? The punishment for those among you who do so is humiliation in this worldly life, and on the Day of Resurrection they will be delivered to the most severe retribution. God is not unaware of what you all do.</span>
<span class=verse id=s2v86 title="Surah 2, Verse 86">These are the ones who have purchased this worldly life instead of the Hereafter. The retribution will not be reduced for them, nor will they be supported.</span>
<span class=verse id=s2v87 title="Surah 2, Verse 87">And We gave Moses the Book, and after him We sent the messengers. And We gave Jesus, son of Mary, the clear proofs, and We supported him with the Holy Spirit. Is it that every time a messenger comes to you with what your souls do not desire, you become arrogant? A group of them you deny, and a group of them you kill!</span>
<span class=verse id=s2v88 title="Surah 2, Verse 88">And they said: "Our hearts are sealed!" No, it is God who has cursed them for their rejection, for very little do they believe.</span>
<span class=verse id=s2v89 title="Surah 2, Verse 89">And when a Book came to them from God, affirming what is with them; while before that they were mocking those who rejected; so when what they knew came to them, they rejected it! The curse of God be upon the rejecters.</span>
<span class=verse id=s2v90 title="Surah 2, Verse 90">Miserable indeed is what they purchase with their souls, that they disbelieve in what God has sent down as a resentment that God would send down from His grace to whom He pleases of His servants; thus they have incurred wrath upon wrath. And the rejecters will have a humiliating retribution.</span>
<span class=verse id=s2v91 title="Surah 2, Verse 91">And if it is said to them: "Believe in what God has sent down;" they say: "We believe only in what was sent down to us," and they reject what came after it, while it is the truth affirming what is with them. Say: "Why then did you kill the prophets of God if you were believers?"</span>
<span class=verse id=s2v92 title="Surah 2, Verse 92">And Moses had come to you with clear proofs, then you took the calf after him; you were wicked!</span>
<span class=verse id=s2v93 title="Surah 2, Verse 93">And We took your covenant, and raised the mount above you: "Take what We have given you with strength, and listen." They said: "We hear and disobey!" And they had consumed the calf inside their hearts by their disbelief. Say: "Miserable indeed is what your belief orders of you if you are believers!"</span>
<span class=verse id=s2v94 title="Surah 2, Verse 94">Say: "If the abode of the Hereafter has been set exclusively for you with God, to the exception of all other people, then you should wish for death if you are truthful!"</span>
<span class=verse id=s2v95 title="Surah 2, Verse 95">They will never wish for it because of what their hands have delivered; and God is aware of the wicked.</span>
<span class=verse id=s2v96 title="Surah 2, Verse 96">And you will find them the most obsessive people regarding longevity; even more than the polytheists; each one of them wishes that he could live a thousand years. It will not change for him the retribution even if he lived so long, God is watchful over what you do.</span>
<span class=verse id=s2v97 title="Surah 2, Verse 97">Say: "Whoever is an enemy to Gabriel, then know that he has sent it down into your heart with the permission of God, affirming what is with him, and a guide and good news for the believers."</span>
<span class=verse id=s2v98 title="Surah 2, Verse 98">"Whoever is an enemy to God and His angels, and His messengers, and Gabriel, and Michael, then so God is the enemy to the disbelievers."</span>
<span class=verse id=s2v99 title="Surah 2, Verse 99">We have sent down to you clear revelations; only the wicked would disbelieve in them.</span>
<span class=verse id=s2v100 title="Surah 2, Verse 100">Is it that each time they make a pledge, a group of them breaks it? Alas, most of them do not believe.</span>
<span class=verse id=s2v101 title="Surah 2, Verse 101">And when a messenger came to them from God, affirming what was with them, a group of those who had already received the Book placed the Book of God behind their backs as if they did not know.</span>
<span class=verse id=s2v102 title="Surah 2, Verse 102">And they followed what the devils recited regarding the kingship of Solomon. Solomon did not reject, but it was the devils who rejected by teaching people magic, and teaching them what was sent down on the two angels in Babylon, Haroot and Maroot. They did not teach anyone until they would say: "We are a test, so do not lose faith!" Thus they teach what can separate between a person and his mate; but they cannot harm anyone except with the permission of God. And they learn what harms them and does not benefit them, and they have known that he who purchases such has no place in the Hereafter. Miserable indeed is what they purchased with their souls if only they knew!</span>
<span class=verse id=s2v103 title="Surah 2, Verse 103">And had they believed and been righteous, it would have brought them a recompense with God which is far better if only they knew!</span>
<span class=verse id=s2v104 title="Surah 2, Verse 104">O you who believe, do not say: "Shepherd us," but say: "Be patient with us," and listen. For the rejecters is a painful retribution.</span>
<span class=verse id=s2v105 title="Surah 2, Verse 105">Neither do those who have rejected from among the people of the Book, nor from among the polytheists, wish that any good comes down to you from your Lord. But God chooses with His mercy whom He wishes; and from God is the greatest grace.</span>
<span class=verse id=s2v106 title="Surah 2, Verse 106">We do not duplicate a sign, or make it forgotten, unless We bring one which is like it or even greater. Did you not know that God is capable of all things?</span>
<span class=verse id=s2v107 title="Surah 2, Verse 107">Did you not know that to God is the kingship of the heavens and the earth, and that you do not have besides God any guardian or supporter?</span>
<span class=verse id=s2v108 title="Surah 2, Verse 108">Or do you want to ask your messenger as Moses was asked before? Whoever replaces belief with rejection, he has indeed strayed from the right path.</span>
<span class=verse id=s2v109 title="Surah 2, Verse 109">Many of the people of the Book have wished that they could return you to being rejecters after your believing, out of envy from their souls after the truth was made clear to them.

<span class=verse id=s2v216 title="Surah 2, Verse 216">Warfare has been decreed for you while you hate it; and perhaps you may hate something while it is good for you, and perhaps you may love something while it is bad for you; and God knows while you do not know.</span>
<span class=verse id=s2v217 title="Surah 2, Verse 217">They ask you about the restricted month: "Is there fighting in it?" Say: "Much fighting is in it, and to repel from the path of God and to disbelieve in it, and the Restricted Temple, to drive its inhabitants out from it is far greater with God, and persecution is worse than being killed." And they still will fight you until they turn you back from your system if they are able. And whoever of you turns back from his system, and he dies while disbelieving, then these have nullified their works in this world and the next; these are the people of the Fire, in it they will abide!</span>
<span class=verse id=s2v218 title="Surah 2, Verse 218">Those who believe, and those who have immigrated and strived in the cause of God; these are seeking the mercy of God; and God is Forgiving, Merciful.</span>
<span class=verse id=s2v219 title="Surah 2, Verse 219">They ask you about intoxicants and gambling. Say: "In them is great harm, and a benefit for the people; but their harm is greater than their benefit." And they ask you how much they are to give, say: "The excess." It is thus that God clarifies for you the revelations that you may think.</span>
<span class=verse id=s2v220 title="Surah 2, Verse 220">In this world and the next; and they ask you regarding the orphans, say: "To fix their situation is best, and if you are to care for them, then they are your brothers." And God knows the corrupt from the good, and if God had wished He could have made things difficult. God is Noble, Wise.</span>
<span class=verse id=s2v221 title="Surah 2, Verse 221">And do not marry the female polytheists until they believe; for a believing servant is better than a polytheist, even if she is pleasing to you. And do not give in marriage to the male polytheists until they believe; for a believing servant is better than a polytheist, even if he is pleasing you. These invite to the Fire, while God is inviting to Paradise and forgiveness by His consent. He clarifies His revelations for the people that they may remember.</span>
<span class=verse id=s2v222 title="Surah 2, Verse 222">And they ask you about the menstruations? Say: "It is harmful, so retire yourselves sexually from the women during the menstruations, and do not approach them until they are cleansed. When they are cleansed, then you may approach them as God has commanded you." God loves the repenters and He loves the cleansed.</span>
<span class=verse id=s2v223 title="Surah 2, Verse 223">Your women are a cultivation for you. So approach your cultivation as you wish towards goodness. And be aware of God and know that you will meet Him, and give good news to the believers.</span>
<span class=verse id=s2v224 title="Surah 2, Verse 224">And do not make God the subject of your casual oaths. Be pious and righteous and reconcile among the people; and God is Hearer, Knower.</span>

<span class=verse id=s2v228 title="Surah 2, Verse 228">And those divorced shall wait for three menstruation periods; and it is not lawful for them to conceal what God has created in their wombs, if they believe in God and the Last Day. And their husbands would then have just cause to return together, if they both wish to reconcile. And the obligations owed to them are to be fulfilled, as are the obligations owed by them. But the men will have a greater responsibility over them in this. And God is Noble, Wise.</span>
<span class=verse id=s2v229 title="Surah 2, Verse 229">The divorce is allowed twice. So, either they remain together equitably, or they part ways with goodness. And it is not lawful for you to take back anything you have given them unless you fear that they will not uphold the boundaries of God. So if you fear that they will not uphold the boundaries of God, then there is no sin upon them for what is given back. These are the boundaries of God so do not transgress them. And whoever shall transgress the boundaries of God, then these are the wicked.</span>
<span class=verse id=s2v230 title="Surah 2, Verse 230">So if he divorces her again, then she will not be lawful for him until after she has married a different husband; if he divorces her; then there is no sin that they come back together if they think they will uphold the boundaries of God. These are the boundaries of God, He clarifies them for a people who know.</span>
<span class=verse id=s2v231 title="Surah 2, Verse 231">And if you have divorced the women, and they have reached their required interim period, then either you remain together equitably, or part ways equitably. And do not reconcile with them so you can harm them out of animosity; whoever does so is doing wrong to his soul; and do not take the revelations of God as mockery. And remember the blessings of God upon you, and what was sent down to you of the Book and the wisdom, He warns you with it. And be aware of God and know that God is knowledgeable of all things.</span>
<span class=verse id=s2v232 title="Surah 2, Verse 232">And if you divorce the women, and they reach their required interim period, then do not make difficulty for them if they wish to remarry their husbands if they have amicably agreed among themselves out of what is best. This is to remind any of you who believe in God and the Last Day, this is better for you and purer; and God knows while you do not know.</span>
<span class=verse id=s2v233 title="Surah 2, Verse 233">And the birth mothers may suckle their children two full cycles, if they wish to complete the suckling. And the man for whom the child is born is responsible for both their provisions and clothing equitably. A soul is not burdened except with what it can bear. No mother shall be harmed because of her child, nor shall a father be harmed because of his child. And for the guardian is the same requirement. So if they wish to separate out of mutual agreement and counsel, then there is no sin upon them. And if you want to hire nursing mothers, then there is no sin upon you if you return what you have been given equitably. And be aware of God, and know that God is watching over what you do.</span>
<span class=verse id=s2v234 title="Surah 2, Verse 234">And those of you whose lives are terminated, and they leave wives behind, they will have a required interim period of four months and ten. So when they reach their required interim, then there is no sin upon you for what they do with themselves in goodness. And God is Expert to what you do.</span>
<span class=verse id=s2v235 title="Surah 2, Verse 235">And there is no sin upon you if you openly propose marriage to the women, or you keep it between yourselves. God knows that you will be thinking about them, but do not meet them secretly, unless you have something righteous to say. And do not finalize the marriage contract until the interim in the book is reached. And know that God knows what is in your souls, so be aware of Him, and know that God is Forgiving, Compassionate.</span>
<span class=verse id=s2v236 title="Surah 2, Verse 236">There is no sin upon you if you divorce the women before having sexual intercourse with them, or before setting the dowry for them. Let them have recompense, the rich according to his means, and the poor according to his means. A recompense in goodness, a responsibility for the good doers.</span>
<span class=verse id=s2v237 title="Surah 2, Verse 237">And if you divorce them before having sexual intercourse with them, but you have already set the dowry for them; then you must give half of what you have agreed, unless they forgive or the guardian over the marriage contract forgives. And if you forgive, it is closer to righteousness. And do not forget the favor between you; God is Seer of what you do.</span>
<span class=verse id=s2v238 title="Surah 2, Verse 238">Maintain the contact prayers, and the central contact prayer; and stand devotedly for God.</span>
<span class=verse id=s2v239 title="Surah 2, Verse 239">But if you are fearful, then you may do so while walking or riding. If you become secure, then remember God as He has taught you what you did not know.</span>
<span class=verse id=s2v240 title="Surah 2, Verse 240">And those of you whose lives are terminated, and they leave wives behind, a decree to their wives that they be provided with support for one year if they do not leave. If they leave then there is no sin upon you for what they do with themselves of goodness; and God is Noble, Wise.</span>
<span class=verse id=s2v241 title="Surah 2, Verse 241">And for those divorced, to have support in goodness is an obligation upon the righteous.</span>
<span class=verse id=s2v242 title="Surah 2, Verse 242">It is such that God clarifies for you His revelations that you may comprehend.</span>
<span class=verse id=s2v243 title="Surah 2, Verse 243">Did you not note those who left their homes in groups, all the while they were fearful of death; so God said to them: "Die," then He resurrected them. God has bestowed a great grace over the people, but most of the people are not thankful.</span>
<span class=verse id=s2v244 title="Surah 2, Verse 244">And fight in the cause of God and know that God is the Hearer, the Knowledgeable.</span>
<span class=verse id=s2v245 title="Surah 2, Verse 245">Who will lend God a loan of righteousness that He may multiply it for him many times over? God collects and He distributes, and to Him you will return.</span>
<span class=verse id=s2v246 title="Surah 2, Verse 246">Did you not note the leaders of the Children of Israel after Moses, they said to their prophet: "Send us a king that we may fight in the cause of God;" he said: "Are you not concerned that if fighting is decreed for you, you will then not fight?" They said: "And why should we not fight in the cause of God when we have been expelled from our homes along with our children." So it was, that when fighting was decreed for them they turned away, except for a few of them! God is fully aware of the wicked.</span>
<span class=verse id=s2v247 title="Surah 2, Verse 247">And their prophet said to them: "God has sent Saul to you as a king." They said: "How can he have the kingship when we are more deserving than him, and he has not been given an abundance of wealth?" He said: "God has chosen him over you and increased him in knowledge and physical stature." God grants His sovereignty to whom He chooses; and God is Encompassing, Knowledgeable.</span>
<span class=verse id=s2v248 title="Surah 2, Verse 248">And their prophet said to them: "The sign of his kingship shall be that he brings to you the ark in which there is tranquility from your Lord and the legacy of what was left behind by the descendants of Moses and the descendants of Aaron being carried by the angels. In this is a sign for you if you are believers."</span>
<span class=verse id=s2v249 title="Surah 2, Verse 249">So when Saul set out with the soldiers, he said: "God will test you with a river, whoever drinks from it is not with me, and whoever does not taste from it except one scoop with his hand is with me." They all drank from it, except for a few of them. So when he and those who believed with him crossed it, they said: "We have no power today against Goliath and his soldiers!" But the ones who understood that they would meet God said: "How many a time has a small group beaten a large group with the permission of God, and God is with the patient ones!"</span>
<span class=verse id=s2v250 title="Surah 2, Verse 250">And when they came forth to Goliath and his soldiers, they said: "Our Lord grant us patience, and make firm our foothold, and grant us victory over the disbelieving people."</span>
<span class=verse id=s2v251 title="Surah 2, Verse 251">So they defeated them with the permission of God, and David killed Goliath, and God gave him the kingship and the wisdom and taught him what he wished. And if it were not for God defending the people against themselves, then the earth would have long been corrupted; but God has bestowed grace upon the worlds.</span>
<span class=verse id=s2v252 title="Surah 2, Verse 252">These are the revelations of God, We recite them to you with the truth, and you are one of the messengers.</span>
<span class=verse id=s2v253 title="Surah 2, Verse 253">Such messengers, We have preferred some over others; some of them talked to God, and He raised some of them in rank, and We gave Jesus, son of Mary, the clear proofs and We supported him with the Holy Spirit. And had God wished, the people after them would not have fought after the proofs had come to them, but they disputed, some of them believed and some of them rejected. If God had wished they would not have fought, but God does what He pleases.</span>
<span class=verse id=s2v254 title="Surah 2, Verse 254">O you who believe, spend from what We have provided for you before a Day comes when there is no trade, nor friendship, nor intercession; and the rejecters are the wicked.</span>
<span class=verse id=s2v255 title="Surah 2, Verse 255">God, there is no god except He, the Living, the Eternal. No slumber or sleep overtakes Him; to Him belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth. Who will intercede with Him except with His permission? He knows their present and their future, and they do not have any of His knowledge except for what He wishes. His Throne encompasses all of the heavens and the earth and it is easy for Him to preserve them. He is the Most High, the Great.</span>
<span class=verse id=s2v256 title="Surah 2, Verse 256">There is no compulsion in the system; the proper way has been clarified from the wrong way. Whoever rejects evil, and believes in God, indeed he has taken grasp of the strongest hold that will never break. God is Hearer, Knower.</span>
<span class=verse id=s2v257 title="Surah 2, Verse 257">God is the ally of those who believe, He brings them out of the darkness and into the light. As for those who reject, their allies are the evil ones, they bring them out of the light and into the darkness; these are the people of the Fire, in it they will abide.</span>
<span class=verse id=s2v258 title="Surah 2, Verse 258">Have you not noted him who debated with Abraham regarding his Lord, while God had given him a kingship? Abraham said: "My Lord is the One who gives life and death," he said: "I bring life and death." Abraham said: "God brings the sun from the east, so you bring it from the west." The one who rejected was baffled! And God does not guide the wicked people.</span>
<span class=verse id=s2v259 title="Surah 2, Verse 259">Or the one who passed through a town which had become ruins. He said: "How can God possibly revive this after it had died?" So God put him to death for one hundred calendar years, then He resurrected him. He said: "How long have you stayed here?" He said: "I have stayed here a day or part of a day." He said: "No, you have stayed here for one hundred calendar years! Look at your food and drink, they have not changed, but look at your donkey! And We will make you a sign for the people; and look at the bones how We expand them, then We cover them with flesh." So when it was clear to him what happened, he said: "I now know that God is capable of all things!"</span>
<span class=verse id=s2v260 title="Surah 2, Verse 260">And Abraham said: "My Lord, show me how you resurrect the dead." He said: "Do you not already believe?" He said: "I do, but it is so my heart can be relieved." He said: "Choose four birds, then cut them, then place parts of the birds on each mountain, then call them to you; they will come racing towards you. And know that God is Noble, Wise."</span>
<span class=verse id=s2v261 title="Surah 2, Verse 261">The example of those who spend their money in the cause of God is like a seed that sprouts forth seven pods, in each pod there is one hundred seeds; and God multiplies for whoever He chooses, and God is Encompassing, Knowledgeable.</span>
<span class=verse id=s2v262 title="Surah 2, Verse 262">Those who spend their money in the cause of God, then they do not follow what they have spent with either insult or harm; they will have their recompense with their Lord, there is no fear over them nor will they grieve.</span>
<span class=verse id=s2v263 title="Surah 2, Verse 263">Kind words and forgiveness are far better than a charity that is followed by harm. God is Rich, Compassionate.</span>
<span class=verse id=s2v264 title="Surah 2, Verse 264">O you who believe, do not nullify your charities with insult and harm; like the one who spends his money in vanity to show off to the people, and he does not believe in God and the Last Day. His example is like a stone on which there is dust, then it is subjected to a heavy rain which leaves it bare. They cannot do anything with what they have earned; and God does not guide the rejecting people.</span>
<span class=verse id=s2v265 title="Surah 2, Verse 265">And the example of those who spend their money seeking the grace of God, and to save their souls, is like the example of a garden that is on a high ground and is subjected to a heavy rain, and because of that it produces double its crop. And if no heavy rain comes, then it still gives enough. And God is Seer of what you do.</span>
<span class=verse id=s2v266 title="Surah 2, Verse 266">Does anyone of you desire that he have an estate with palm trees and grapevines, and rivers flowing beneath it, and in it for him are all kinds of fruits, then he is afflicted with old age and his progeny is weak, and a firestorm strikes it and it all burns? It is thus that God makes clear for you the signs that you may reflect.</span>
<span class=verse id=s2v267 title="Surah 2, Verse 267">O you who believe, spend from the good things that you have earned, and from what We have brought forth from the earth. And do not select the rotten out of it to give, while you would not take it yourselves unless you closed your eyes regarding it. And know that God is Rich, Praiseworthy.</span>
<span class=verse id=s2v268 title="Surah 2, Verse 268">The devil promises you poverty and orders you to immorality, while God promises forgiveness from Him and grace. God is Encompassing, Knowledgeable.</span>
<span class=verse id=s2v269 title="Surah 2, Verse 269">He grants wisdom to whom He chooses, and whoever is granted wisdom has been given much good. Only those who possess intelligence will remember.</span>
<span class=verse id=s2v270 title="Surah 2, Verse 270">And whatever you spend out of your monies, or whatever you pledge as a promise, then God knows it. The wicked have no supporters.</span>
<span class=verse id=s2v271 title="Surah 2, Verse 271">If you openly give charities, then it is acceptable; but if you conceal them and give them to the poor, then that is better for you. And He cancels some of your sins; and God is Expert to all that you do.</span>
<span class=verse id=s2v272 title="Surah 2, Verse 272">You are not responsible for their guidance, but it is God who will guide whoever He wishes. And whatever you spend out of goodness is for your own souls. And anything you spend should be in seeking the face of God. And whatever you spend out of goodness will be returned to you, and you will not be wronged.</span>
<span class=verse id=s2v273 title="Surah 2, Verse 273">For the poor who face hardship in the cause of God, they cannot go forth in the land; the ignorant ones think they are rich from their modesty; you know them by their features, they do not ask the people repeatedly. And what you spend out of goodness, God is fully aware of it.</span>
<span class=verse id=s2v274 title="Surah 2, Verse 274">Those who spend their money in the night and in the day, secretly and openly, they will have their recompense with their Lord, there is no fear over them nor will they grieve.</span>
<span class=verse id=s2v275 title="Surah 2, Verse 275">Those who consume usury do not rise except as one being influenced by the touch of the devil. That is because they have said: "Trade is the same as usury." While God has made trade lawful, and He has made usury unlawful. Whoever has received understanding from His Lord and ceases, then he will be forgiven for what was before this and his case will be with God. But whoever returns, then they are the people of the Fire, in it they will abide.</span>
<span class=verse id=s2v276 title="Surah 2, Verse 276">God condemns usury, and He grants growth to the charities. And God does not love any wicked sinner.</span>
<span class=verse id=s2v277 title="Surah 2, Verse 277">Those who believe and do good works, and hold the contact prayer, and contribute towards purification; they will have their recompense with their Lord and there is no fear over them nor will they grieve.</span>

<span class=verse id=s2v281 title="Surah 2, Verse 281">And be aware of a Day when you will be returned to God then every soul will be paid what it has earned, and they will not be wronged.</span>
<span class=verse id=s2v282 title="Surah 2, Verse 282">O you who believe, if you borrow for a future period, then you shall record it. And let a scribe of justice record it for you; and let not the scribe refuse to record as God has taught him. Let him record and let the person who is borrowing dictate to him, and let him be aware of God, and let him not reduce from it anything. If the one who is borrowing is immature or weak or he cannot dictate himself, then let his guardian dictate with justice; and bring two witnesses from among your men; if there are not two men, then a man and two women from whom you will accept their testimony, so that if one of them becomes blindsided, then the one can remind the other. And let the witnesses not refuse to come if they are called. And do not fail to record it no matter how small or large until its maturity. That is more just with God and better for the testimony, and better that you do not have doubts; except if it is a trade to be done on the spot between you, then there is no sin upon you if you do not record it. And have evidence if you trade. No scribe shall be harmed nor any witness; for if you do so then it is a wickedness on your part, and be aware of God and God teaches you and God is aware of all things.</span>
<span class=verse id=s2v283 title="Surah 2, Verse 283">And if you are traveling or do not find a scribe, then a pledge of collateral. So, if you have entrusted each other in this manner, then let the one who was entrusted deliver his trust, and let him be aware of God his Lord. And do not hold back the testimony. And whoever holds it back, then he has sinned in his heart, and God is aware of what you do.</span>
<span class=verse id=s2v284 title="Surah 2, Verse 284">To God is what is in the heavens and in earth, and whether you declare what is in your souls or hide it, God will call you to account for it. He will forgive whom He wishes, and punish whom He wishes, and God is capable of all things.</span>
<span class=verse id=s2v285 title="Surah 2, Verse 285">The messenger believes in what was sent down to him from his Lord; and the believers, all who believe in God, and His angels, and His Books, and His messengers: "We do not make a distinction between any of His messengers;" and they said: "We hear and obey, forgive us our Lord, and to you is our destiny."</span>
<span class=verse id=s2v286 title="Surah 2, Verse 286">God does not burden a soul except with what it can bear. For it is what it earns, and against it is what it earns. "Our Lord, do not mind us if we forget or make mistakes; our Lord, do not place a burden upon us as You have placed upon those before us; our Lord, do not place upon us what we cannot bear; pardon us, and forgive us, and have mercy on us; You are our patron, so grant us victory over the disbelieving people."</span>

<span class=verse id=s3v142 title="Surah 3, Verse 142">Or did you think that you would enter Paradise without God distinguishing those who would strive among you and distinguishing those who are patient?</span>
<span class=verse id=s3v143 title="Surah 3, Verse 143">And you used to long for death before you came upon it; so now you see it right in front of you!</span>
<span class=verse id=s3v144 title="Surah 3, Verse 144">And Mohammed is but a messenger, like many messengers who have passed before him. If he dies or is killed will you turn back on your heels? And whoever turns back on his heels, he will not harm God in the least. And God will recompense the thankful.</span>
<span class=verse id=s3v145 title="Surah 3, Verse 145">It is not permitted for a person to die except by the permission of God in an appointed record. And whoever wants the reward of this world We give him of it, and whoever wants the reward of the Hereafter, We give him of it. And We will reward the thankful.</span>
<span class=verse id=s3v146 title="Surah 3, Verse 146">And many a prophet had a large number of Devotees fighting with him. They did not waver by what afflicted them in the cause of God, nor did they become weak, nor did they become discouraged; and God loves the patient ones.</span>
<span class=verse id=s3v147 title="Surah 3, Verse 147">And they did not say except: "Our Lord, forgive us our sins and our shortcomings in our responsibility, and make firm our foothold, and grant us victory over the rejecting people."</span>
<span class=verse id=s3v148 title="Surah 3, Verse 148">So God gave them the reward of this world and the best reward of the Hereafter; and God loves the good doers.</span>
<span class=verse id=s3v149 title="Surah 3, Verse 149">O you who believe, if you obey those who have rejected, then they will turn you back on your heels and you will turn back as losers.</span>
<span class=verse id=s3v150 title="Surah 3, Verse 150">It is God who is your Patron, and He is the best victor.</span>
<span class=verse id=s3v151 title="Surah 3, Verse 151">We will cast terror in the hearts of those who have rejected, because of what they have set up besides God while He never sent down any authority to do so, and their destiny is the Fire. Miserable is the abode of the wicked.</span>
<span class=verse id=s3v152 title="Surah 3, Verse 152">And God has fulfilled His promise to you, that you would overwhelm them with His permission; but then you failed and disputed in the matter and disobeyed after He showed you what you had sought. Some of you want this world, and some of you want the Hereafter. Then He let you retreat from them that He may test you; and He has pardoned you. God is with great grace over the believers.</span>
<span class=verse id=s3v153 title="Surah 3, Verse 153">For you were ascending to the high ground and would not even glance towards anyone, and the messenger was calling to you from behind. Therefore He gave you worry to replace your worry, so that you would not have sadness by what has passed you, or for what afflicted you, and God is Expert over what you do.</span>
<span class=verse id=s3v154 title="Surah 3, Verse 154">Then He sent down to you after the worry a tranquility in sleepiness, it overtook a group of you; and another group was obsessed with themselves, they were thinking about God other than the truth, the thoughts of the days of ignorance. They say: "Why are we involved in this affair?" Say: "The entire affair is for God." They hide in their souls what they do not show to you, they say: "If we had a say in this affair then none of us would have been killed here." Say: "If you were inside your own homes, then the ones who had been marked for death would have come out to their resting place." God will test what is in your chests and bring out what is in your hearts. God is Knowledgeable as to what is in the chests.</span>
<span class=verse id=s3v155 title="Surah 3, Verse 155">Those of you who turned away on the day that the two hosts met, it was the devil who caused them to slip due to some of what they had earned. And God has pardoned them, for God is Forgiver, Compassionate.</span>
<span class=verse id=s3v156 title="Surah 3, Verse 156">O you who believe do not be like those who rejected and said to their brothers when they had gone forth in the land or on the offensive: "If they were here with us they would not have died nor been killed." God will make this a source of grief in their hearts, and God grants life and death, and God is watching over what you do.</span>
<span class=verse id=s3v157 title="Surah 3, Verse 157">And if you are killed in the cause of God or die, then forgiveness from God and mercy are far greater than all they can put together.</span>
<span class=verse id=s3v158 title="Surah 3, Verse 158">And if you die or are killed, then to God you will be gathered.</span>
<span class=verse id=s3v159 title="Surah 3, Verse 159">It was a mercy from God that you were soft towards them; had you been harsh and hard-hearted, they would have dispersed from you; so pardon them and ask forgiveness for them, and consult them in the matter; but when you are convinced, then put your trust in God; for God loves those who put their trust.</span>
<span class=verse id=s3v160 title="Surah 3, Verse 160">If God grants you victory then none can defeat you, and if He abandons you then who can grant you victory after Him? And towards God the believers should put their trust.</span>
<span class=verse id=s3v161 title="Surah 3, Verse 161">It was not for any prophet to embezzle, and he who embezzles will be brought with what he has embezzled on the Day of Resurrection, then every soul will be given what it has earned without being wronged.</span>
<span class=verse id=s3v162 title="Surah 3, Verse 162">Is he who follows the pleasure of God as he who draws the wrath of God and his abode is Hell and a miserable destiny?</span>
<span class=verse id=s3v163 title="Surah 3, Verse 163">They are in grades with God, and God is Seer of what they do.</span>
<span class=verse id=s3v164 title="Surah 3, Verse 164">God has bestowed grace upon the believers by sending them a messenger from among themselves reciting His revelations and purifying them and teaching them the Book and the wisdom, and they were before in manifest darkness.</span>
<span class=verse id=s3v165 title="Surah 3, Verse 165">And so it was when you suffered setback; even though you afflicted them with twice as much setback; you said: "Where is this coming from?" Say: "It is from yourselves." God is capable of all things.</span>
<span class=verse id=s3v166 title="Surah 3, Verse 166">And what you suffered on the day the two hosts met was with the permission of God, and to let the believers know.</span>
<span class=verse id=s3v167 title="Surah 3, Verse 167">And to let those who are hypocrites know, that they were told: "Come fight in the cause of God or defend," they said: "If we knew how to fight we would have followed you." They are closer to rejection than they are to belief. They say with their mouths what is not in their hearts, and God is aware of what they conceal.</span>
<span class=verse id=s3v168 title="Surah 3, Verse 168">Those who remained and said to their brothers: "If they obeyed us they would not have been killed." Say: "Then avert death away from yourselves if you are truthful!"</span>
<span class=verse id=s3v169 title="Surah 3, Verse 169">And do not think that those who are killed in the cause of God are dead. No, they are alive at their Lord receiving a bounty.</span>
<span class=verse id=s3v170 title="Surah 3, Verse 170">Happy with what God has granted them from His grace, and they rejoice in those who have yet to follow after them. There is no fear upon them nor do they grieve.</span>
<span class=verse id=s3v171 title="Surah 3, Verse 171">They rejoice with the bounty of God and grace; God will not waste the recompense of the believers.</span>
<span class=verse id=s3v172 title="Surah 3, Verse 172">Those who have answered God and the messenger after they were afflicted with wounds. For those of them who did good and were righteous is a great recompense.</span>
<span class=verse id=s3v173 title="Surah 3, Verse 173">The ones who the people said to them: "The people have gathered against you, so be concerned by them," but it only increased their faith and they said: "God is sufficient for us, and He is the best to put our trust in."</span>
<span class=verse id=s3v174 title="Surah 3, Verse 174">So they came back with a recompense from God and a bounty, no harm would touch them. And they had followed the pleasure of God, and God is the One with great pleasure.</span>
<span class=verse id=s3v175 title="Surah 3, Verse 175">It is only the devil trying to create fear for his allies, so do not fear them, but fear Me if you are believers.</span>
<span class=verse id=s3v176 title="Surah 3, Verse 176">And do not be saddened by those who rush into disbelief. They will not harm God in the least. God does not wish to make for them any share in the Hereafter, and they will have a painful retribution.</span>
<span class=verse id=s3v177 title="Surah 3, Verse 177">Those who have purchased rejection with belief will not harm God in the least, and they will have a painful retribution.</span>
<span class=verse id=s3v178 title="Surah 3, Verse 178">And let not those who reject think that We are providing for them out of the goodness of themselves. We are only providing for them so that they may increase in transgression, and they will have a humiliating retribution.</span>
<span class=verse id=s3v179 title="Surah 3, Verse 179">God was not to leave the believers as they were without distinguishing the rotten from the good. And God was not to let you know the future, but God chooses from His messengers whom He wishes; so believe in God and His messengers. And if you believe and are righteous, then you will have a great recompense.</span>
<span class=verse id=s3v180 title="Surah 3, Verse 180">And let not those who are stingy with what God has given them of His bounty think that it is good for them, no, it is evil for them. They will be surrounded by what they were stingy with on the Day of Resurrection. And to God will be the inheritance of the heavens and the earth; and God is Expert over what you do.</span>
<span class=verse id=s3v181 title="Surah 3, Verse 181">God has heard the words of those who said: "God is poor and we are rich!" We will record what they have said and their killing of the prophets without right; and We will say: "Taste the retribution of the Fire!"</span>
<span class=verse id=s3v182 title="Surah 3, Verse 182">This is for what their hands have delivered, and God does not wrong the servants.</span>
<span class=verse id=s3v183 title="Surah 3, Verse 183">Those who said: "God has pledged to us that we should not believe in a messenger unless he brings us an offering which the fire will devour." Say: "Messengers have come to you before me with clarity and with what you have said, so why did you kill them if you were truthful?"</span>
<span class=verse id=s3v184 title="Surah 3, Verse 184">If they deny you, then messengers before you were also denied; they came with the proofs and the scriptures and the Book of Enlightenment.</span>
<span class=verse id=s3v185 title="Surah 3, Verse 185">Every person will taste death, and you will be recompensed your dues on the Day of Resurrection. Whoever is swayed from the Fire and entered into Paradise, he has indeed won. This worldly life is nothing more than the enjoyment of vanity.</span>
<span class=verse id=s3v186 title="Surah 3, Verse 186">We will test you in your wealth and in yourselves, and you will hear from those who have been given the Book from before you and from the polytheists much annoyance. And if you are patient and righteous, then that is from a strength of conviction.</span>
<span class=verse id=s3v187 title="Surah 3, Verse 187">And God took the covenant of those who were given the Book: "You will make it clear to the people and not conceal it." But they placed it behind their backs and purchased with it a cheap price. Miserable indeed is what they have purchased.</span>
<span class=verse id=s3v188 title="Surah 3, Verse 188">Do not think that those who are happy with what they have been given, and they love to be praised for what they did not do; do not think they are saved from the punishment. For them is a painful retribution.</span>
<span class=verse id=s3v189 title="Surah 3, Verse 189">And to God is the sovereignty of the heavens and the earth, and God is capable of all things.</span>
<span class=verse id=s3v190 title="Surah 3, Verse 190">In the creation of the heavens and the earth, and the difference between the night and the day, are signs for those who possess intelligence.</span>

<span class=verse id=s3v193 title="Surah 3, Verse 193">"Our Lord, we have heard a caller inviting to the faith: "Believe in your Lord," so we have believed. Our Lord forgive us our bad deeds, and forgive our sins, and let us die in the company of the righteous."</span>
<span class=verse id=s3v194 title="Surah 3, Verse 194">"Our Lord, and grant us what You have promised through Your messengers, and do not embarrass us on the Day of Resurrection. You do not break the promise."</span>
<span class=verse id=s3v195 title="Surah 3, Verse 195">Their Lord answered them: "I do not waste the work of any worker from among you, whether male or female, you are all as each other. For those who emigrated and were driven out from their homes and were harmed in My cause, and they fought and were killed, I will forgive for them their sins and admit them to estates with rivers flowing beneath them." A recompense from God; and God has the best recompense.</span>
<span class=verse id=s3v196 title="Surah 3, Verse 196">Do not be deceived by the success of those who have rejected in the land.</span>
<span class=verse id=s3v197 title="Surah 3, Verse 197">A brief enjoyment, then their abode is Hell. What a miserable abode!</span>

<span class=verse id=s4v1 title="Surah 4, Verse 1">O people, be aware of your Lord who has created you from one person and He created from it its mate and sent forth from it many men and many women; and be aware of God whom you ask about, and the relatives. God is Watcher over you.</span>
<span class=verse id=s4v2 title="Surah 4, Verse 2">And give the orphans their money, and do not replace the good with the bad, and do not consume their money with your money; for truly this is a great sin!</span>
<span class=verse id=s4v3 title="Surah 4, Verse 3">And if you fear that you cannot be just to the orphans, then you may marry those who are agreeable to you of the women: two, and three, and four. But if you fear you will not be fair, then only one, or whom you maintain by your oaths. This is best that you do not face financial hardship.</span>
<span class=verse id=s4v4 title="Surah 4, Verse 4">And give the women their dues willingly, and if they remit any of it to you of their own will, then you may take it with good feelings.</span>
<span class=verse id=s4v5 title="Surah 4, Verse 5">And do not give the immature ones your money for which God has made you overseers, and spend on them from it and clothe them, and speak to them in goodness.</span>
<span class=verse id=s4v6 title="Surah 4, Verse 6">And test the orphans when they reach puberty, then, if you have determined from them comprehension, then give them their money, and do not deliberately consume it wastefully or quickly before they grow up. And whoever is rich, then let him not claim anything, and if he is poor then let him consume in kindness. If you give to them their money, then make a witness for them, and God is enough for Reckoning.</span>
<span class=verse id=s4v7 title="Surah 4, Verse 7">For the men is a portion from what the parents and the relatives left behind, and for the women is a portion from what the parents and relatives left behind, be it little or much; a forced portion.</span>
<span class=verse id=s4v8 title="Surah 4, Verse 8">And if the distribution is attended by the relatives and the orphans and the needy, then you shall give them part of it and say to them a kind saying.</span>
<span class=verse id=s4v9 title="Surah 4, Verse 9">And let them be concerned, that if it was they who had left behind them a weak progeny, would they not fear for them? Let them reverence God and let them say what is appropriate.</span>
<span class=verse id=s4v10 title="Surah 4, Verse 10">Those who consume the money of the orphans illicitly, in fact they are consuming fire in their bellies, and they will endure the Blaze.</span>
<span class=verse id=s4v11 title="Surah 4, Verse 11">God directs you regarding your children: "To the male shall be as that given to two females; however, if the women are more than two, then they will have two thirds of what is left behind; and if she is only one, then she will have one half. And to his parents, each one of them shall have one sixth of what is left behind, if he has a child. If he has no child, and his parents are the heirs, then to his mother is one third; and if he has siblings then to his mother is one sixth. All after a will is carried through or a debt. Your parents and your children, you do not know which are closer to you in benefit-a directive from God, for God is Knowledgeable, Wise."</span>
<span class=verse id=s4v12 title="Surah 4, Verse 12">And for you is half from your wives of what is left behind, if they have no child; however, if they have a child, then to you is one quarter of what is left behind. All after a will is carried through or a debt. And to them is one quarter of what is left behind, if you have no child; however, if you have a child, then to them is one eighth of what is left behind. All after a will is carried through or a debt. And if a man or a woman who is being inherited has no dependents, but has a brother or a sister, then to each one of them is one sixth, but if they are more than this then they are to share in one third. All after a will is carried through or a debt, to avoid causing harm. A directive from God, and God is Knowledgeable, Compassionate.</span>
<span class=verse id=s4v13 title="Surah 4, Verse 13">These are the boundaries of God, and whoever obeys God and His messenger, He will admit him to estates with rivers flowing beneath them, abiding therein. This is the great triumph.</span>
<span class=verse id=s4v14 title="Surah 4, Verse 14">And whoever disobeys God and His messenger, and transgresses His boundaries, He will admit him to a Fire, abiding therein, and he will have a humiliating retribution.</span>
<span class=verse id=s4v15 title="Surah 4, Verse 15">And those of your women who commit lewdness, you shall bring four witnesses over them from among you; if they bear witness, then you shall restrict them in the homes until death terminates their lives, or God makes for them a way out.</span>
<span class=verse id=s4v16 title="Surah 4, Verse 16">And the two men who commit it from among you, you shall trouble them. If they repent and reform, then leave them alone. God is Redeemer, Merciful.</span>
<span class=verse id=s4v17 title="Surah 4, Verse 17">Repentance is only for those who commit a sin out of ignorance and then repent soon after; these will be forgiven by God, for God is Knowledgeable, Wise.</span>
<span class=verse id=s4v18 title="Surah 4, Verse 18">And there will be no repentance for those who commit sin then when death comes upon any one of them he says: "I repent now!" Nor for those who die while they are rejecters. For those We have prepared a painful retribution.</span>
<span class=verse id=s4v19 title="Surah 4, Verse 19">O you who believe, it is not lawful for you to inherit from the women by force. And do not make difficulty for them so that you may take away some of what you have given them, unless they commit a clear lewdness. And live with them in kindness. If you dislike them, then perhaps you dislike something while God makes in it much good.</span>
<span class=verse id=s4v20 title="Surah 4, Verse 20">And if you wish to replace one wife with another, and you have given one of them a large amount, then do not take anything from it. Will you take it by falsehood while it is clearly a sin?</span>
<span class=verse id=s4v21 title="Surah 4, Verse 21">And how can you take it when you have become intimate with each other, and they have taken from you a solemn covenant.</span>
<span class=verse id=s4v22 title="Surah 4, Verse 22">And do not marry who your fathers had married from the women, except what has already been done. It is a lewdness, and an abhorrence, and an evil path.</span>
<span class=verse id=s4v23 title="Surah 4, Verse 23">Forbidden for you are your mothers, and your daughters, and your sisters, and the sisters of your father, and the sisters of your mother, and the daughters of your brother, and the daughters of your sister, and your foster mothers who suckled you, and your sisters from suckling, and the mothers of your women, and your step-daughters who are in your lodgings from your women with whom you have already consummated the marriage; if you have not consummated the marriage then there is no sin upon you; and those who were in wedlock with your sons who are from your seed, and that you join between two sisters except what has already been done. God is Forgiving, Merciful.</span>
<span class=verse id=s4v24 title="Surah 4, Verse 24">And the independent from the women, except those maintained by your oaths; the book of God over you; and permitted for you is what is beyond this, if you are seeking with your money to be independent, not for illicit sex. As for those whom you have already had joy with, then you shall give them their dowries as an obligation. There is no sin upon you for what you agree on after the obligation. God is Knowledgeable, Wise.</span>
<span class=verse id=s4v25 title="Surah 4, Verse 25">And whoever of you cannot afford to marry the independent female believers, then from those maintained by your oaths of the believing young women. And God is more aware of your faith, some of you to each other. You shall marry them with the permission of their parents, and give them their dowries in kindness-to be independent-not for illicit sex or taking lovers. Until they become independent, any of them who comes with an immorality shall have half of what is the punishment for those who are independent. This is for those who fear hardship from among you. But if you are patient it is better for you, and God is Forgiver, Merciful.</span>
<span class=verse id=s4v26 title="Surah 4, Verse 26">God wants to clarify for you and guide you to the paths of those before you, and pardon you, and God is Knowledgeable, Wise.</span>
<span class=verse id=s4v27 title="Surah 4, Verse 27">And God wants to pardon you, but those who follow desires want that you would be diverted into a great diversion.</span>
<span class=verse id=s4v28 title="Surah 4, Verse 28">God wants to alleviate for you; and mankind was created weak.</span>
<span class=verse id=s4v29 title="Surah 4, Verse 29">O you who believe, do not consume your money between you unjustly, unless it is through a trade which is mutually agreed by you. And do not kill yourselves; God is Merciful towards you.</span>
<span class=verse id=s4v30 title="Surah 4, Verse 30">And whoever does so out of animosity and transgression, We will cast him to a Fire; and this for God is very easy.</span>
<span class=verse id=s4v31 title="Surah 4, Verse 31">If you avoid the major sins that you are prohibited against, then We will cancel your existing sins and admit you to a generous entrance.</span>
<span class=verse id=s4v32 title="Surah 4, Verse 32">And do not envy that which God has graced some of you over others with. For the men is a portion of what they earned, and for the women is a portion of what they earned. And ask God from His grace; God is knowledgeable in all things.</span>
<span class=verse id=s4v33 title="Surah 4, Verse 33">And for each We have made inheritors for what was left behind by the parents and the relatives. And those bound by your oaths, you shall give them their portion. God is witness over all things.</span>
<span class=verse id=s4v34 title="Surah 4, Verse 34">The men are to support the women with what God has bestowed upon them over one another and for what they spend of their money. The upright females are devoted; keeping private the personal matters for what God keeps watch over. As for those females from whom you fear desertion, then you shall advise them, and abandon them in the bedchamber, and separate from them. If they respond to you, then do not seek a way over them; God is Most High, Great.</span>
<span class=verse id=s4v35 title="Surah 4, Verse 35">And if you fear a permanent rift between them, then send a judge from his family and a judge from her family. If they want to reconcile, then God will bring them together. God is Knowledgeable, Expert.</span>
<span class=verse id=s4v36 title="Surah 4, Verse 36">And serve God and do not set up anything with Him, and do good to the parents, and the relatives, and the orphans, and the needy, and the neighbor who is a relative, and the neighbor nearby, and the friend nearby, and the wayfarer, and those maintained by your oaths. God does not love the arrogant, the boastful.</span>
<span class=verse id=s4v37 title="Surah 4, Verse 37">Those who are stingy and order the people to stinginess, and they conceal what God has given them from His bounty. And We have prepared for the rejecters a humiliating retribution.</span>
<span class=verse id=s4v38 title="Surah 4, Verse 38">And those who spend their money to show off to the people, and they do not believe in God or the Last Day. And whoever has the devil as his associate, then what a miserable associate!</span>
<span class=verse id=s4v39 title="Surah 4, Verse 39">What would bother them if they believed in God and the Last Day and spent from the provisions of God? God is aware of them.</span>
<span class=verse id=s4v40 title="Surah 4, Verse 40">Indeed, God does not wrong the weight of an atom; and if it is good He will double it. And He grants from Himself a great recompense.</span>
<span class=verse id=s4v41 title="Surah 4, Verse 41">How is it then when We bring forth from every nation a witness, and bring you as a witness over these?</span>
<span class=verse id=s4v42 title="Surah 4, Verse 42">On that Day those who rejected and disobeyed the messenger will wish that the earth would swallow them; but they cannot hide any narrative from God.</span>
<span class=verse id=s4v43 title="Surah 4, Verse 43">O you who believe, do not come near the contact prayer while you are intoxicated, until you know what you are saying. Nor if you have had intercourse, unless a wayfarer, until you wash. And if you are ill, or traveling, or one of you has excreted feces, or you had sexual contact with the women, and could not find water, then you shall select from the clean soil; you shall wipe your faces and hands. God is Pardoning, Forgiving.</span>

Indeed, God has stamped upon their hearts because of their rejection; they do not believe, except for a few.</span>
<span class=verse id=s4v156 title="Surah 4, Verse 156">And for their rejection and their saying about Mary a great falsehood.</span>
<span class=verse id=s4v157 title="Surah 4, Verse 157">And their saying: "We have killed the Messiah, Jesus, son of Mary, messenger of God!" And they had not killed him, nor crucified him, but it appeared to them as if they had. And those who dispute are in doubt regarding him, they have no knowledge except to follow conjecture; they did not kill him for a certainty.</span>
<span class=verse id=s4v158 title="Surah 4, Verse 158">Instead, God had raised him to Himself; and God is Noble, Wise.</span>
<span class=verse id=s4v159 title="Surah 4, Verse 159">And from the people of the Book are those who refused to believe in him before his death, and on the Day of Resurrection he will be witness against them.</span>
<span class=verse id=s4v160 title="Surah 4, Verse 160">Because of the wickedness from among those who are Jewish, We made unlawful to them the good things that were lawful to them; and for their deterring many from the path of God.</span>
<span class=verse id=s4v161 title="Surah 4, Verse 161">And for their taking of usury, while they were prohibited from doing so, and for their consuming the money of the people unjustly. We have prepared for the disbelievers among them a painful retribution.</span>
<span class=verse id=s4v162 title="Surah 4, Verse 162">But those of them who are well founded in knowledge, and the believers, they believe in what was sent down to you and what was sent down before you; and those who hold the contact prayer, and those who contribute towards purification, and those who believe in God and the Last Day; to these We will give them their recompense greatly.</span>
<span class=verse id=s4v163 title="Surah 4, Verse 163">We have inspired you as We had inspired Noah and the prophets after him. And We had inspired Abraham, and Ishmael, and Isaac, and Jacob, and the Patriarchs, and Jesus, and Job, and Jonah, and Aaron, and Solomon; and We gave David the Psalms.</span>
<span class=verse id=s4v164 title="Surah 4, Verse 164">And messengers of whom We have told to you from before, and messengers We have not told to you; and God spoke to Moses directly.</span>
<span class=verse id=s4v165 title="Surah 4, Verse 165">Messengers who were bearers of good news and warners, so that there will be no excuse for the people with God after the messengers. God is Noble, Wise.</span>
<span class=verse id=s4v166 title="Surah 4, Verse 166">But God bears witness for what He has sent down to you with His knowledge, and the angels bear witness; and God is enough as a witness.</span>
<span class=verse id=s4v167 title="Surah 4, Verse 167">Those who have rejected and turned away from the path of God, they have strayed a far straying.</span>
<span class=verse id=s4v168 title="Surah 4, Verse 168">Those who have rejected and did wrong, God was not to forgive them, nor guide them to a path.</span>
<span class=verse id=s4v169 title="Surah 4, Verse 169">Except to the path of Hell, they will abide therein eternally. For God this is very easy.</span>
<span class=verse id=s4v170 title="Surah 4, Verse 170">O people, a messenger has come to you with the truth from your Lord, so believe; that is better for you. And if you reject, then to God is what is in the heavens and the earth. And God is Knowledgeable, Wise.</span>
<span class=verse id=s4v171 title="Surah 4, Verse 171">O people of the Book, do not overstep in your system, nor say about God except the truth. Jesus, son of Mary, was no more than a messenger of God and His word, which He cast to Mary, and a Spirit from Him. So believe in God and His messengers, and do not say: "Three." Cease, for it is better for you. God is only One god, be He glorified that He should have a son! To Him is all that is in the heavens and the earth; and God is enough as a Caretaker.</span>
<span class=verse id=s4v172 title="Surah 4, Verse 172">The Messiah is not too proud to be a servant to God, nor are the angels who are close to Him. Whoever is too proud from His service, and is arrogant, then He will gather them all towards Him together.</span>
<span class=verse id=s4v173 title="Surah 4, Verse 173">As for those who believe and do good works, He will give them their recompense and increase for them from His bounty. And as for those who are too proud and arrogant, He will punish them a painful retribution, and they will not find besides God any supporter or victor.</span>
<span class=verse id=s4v174 title="Surah 4, Verse 174">O people, proof has come to you from your Lord, and We have sent down to you a guiding light.</span>

<span class=verse id=s4v176 title="Surah 4, Verse 176">They seek a ruling from you, say: "God gives you the ruling for those who have no dependants. If a person passes away and has no child, but has a sister, then she shall receive half of what is left behind; and he will inherit from her if she has no child. However, if he has two sisters, then they will receive two thirds of what is left behind; and if he has siblings, men and women, then the male shall receive twice what the female receives." God makes clear to you that you do not stray; God is aware of all things.</span>

<span class=verse id=s5v0 title="Surah 5, Verse 0"><em>In the name of God, the Almighty, the Merciful.</em></span>
<span class=verse id=s5v1 title="Surah 5, Verse 1">O you who believe, honor the contracts. Made lawful for you are the animals of the livestock, except that which is being recited to you. Do not make lawful the hunting of game while you are under restriction. God decrees as He pleases.</span>
<span class=verse id=s5v2 title="Surah 5, Verse 2">O you who believe, do not violate the symbols of God, nor the restricted month, nor the offerings, nor the regulations, nor the safety made by the Restricted Shrine; for they are seeking a bounty from their Lord and a blessing. And when it is permitted for you, then you may hunt. And let not the hatred of another people; because they had barred you from the Restricted Temple; make you aggress. And help each other in piety and righteousness, and do not help each other in sin and aggression. And be aware of God, for the retribution of God is severe.</span>
<span class=verse id=s5v3 title="Surah 5, Verse 3">Forbidden for you is carrion, and blood, and the meat of pig, and what was sacrificed to other than God, and that which has been strangled, and that which has been bludgeoned, and that which has fallen from a height, and that which has been gored, and that which a wild animal has savaged-unless it was slaughtered while it still lived, and what has been slaughtered on altars, and what you divide through arrows of chance. This is all vile. Today the rejecters have given up from your system, so do not be concerned by them, but be concerned by Me. Today I have perfected your system for you, and completed My blessings upon you, and I have approved submission as the system for you. So, whoever is forced by severe hunger and not seeking sin, then God is Forgiving, Merciful.</span>
<span class=verse id=s5v4 title="Surah 5, Verse 4">They ask you what was made lawful to them, say: "All the good things have been made lawful for you, and what the trained dogs and birds catch, you teach them from what God teaches you." So eat from what they have captured for you and mention the name of God upon it, and be aware of God. God is swift in reckoning.</span>
<span class=verse id=s5v5 title="Surah 5, Verse 5">Today, the good things have been made lawful to you, and the food of those who have been given the Book is lawful for you, and your food is lawful for them; and the independent females from those who are believers, and the independent females from those who have been given the Book before you, if you have given them their dowries, to be independent, not for illicit sex or taking lovers. And whoever rejects belief, then his work has fallen, and in the Hereafter he is of the losers.</span>
<span class=verse id=s5v6 title="Surah 5, Verse 6">O you who believe, if you rise to hold the contact prayer, then wash your faces and your hands up to the elbows, and wipe your heads and your feet to the ankles; and if you have had intercourse, then you shall purify. And if you are ill, or traveling, or you have excreted feces, or you have had sexual contact with the women, and you cannot not find water, then you shall select from the clean soil; you shall wipe your faces and your hands with it. God does not want to place any hardship on you, but He wants to cleanse you and to complete His blessings upon you that you may be thankful.</span>
<span class=verse id=s5v7 title="Surah 5, Verse 7">And remember the blessings of God over you and His covenant that He has bound you with, for which you have said: "We hear and obey," and be aware of God; for God knows what is in the chests.</span>
<span class=verse id=s5v8 title="Surah 5, Verse 8">O you who believe, stand for God and be witnesses for justice, and let not the hatred towards a people make you avoid being just. Be just, for it is closer to righteousness, and be aware of God. God is expert over what you do.</span>
<span class=verse id=s5v9 title="Surah 5, Verse 9">God has promised those who believe and do good works that they will have forgiveness and a great recompense.</span>
<span class=verse id=s5v10 title="Surah 5, Verse 10">And those who reject and deny Our revelations, they are the dwellers of Hell.</span>
<span class=verse id=s5v11 title="Surah 5, Verse 11">O you who believe, remember the blessings of God upon you when a group desired to aggress against  you, and He restrained their hands from you. And reverence God. And in God the believers should put their trust.</span>
<span class=verse id=s5v12 title="Surah 5, Verse 12">God has taken the covenant of the Children of Israel and raised from them twelve representatives, and God said: "I am with you if you hold the contact prayer, and contribute towards purification, and believe in My messengers, and support them, and lend God a loan of righteousness; then I will cancel your sins and admit you into estates with rivers flowing beneath them." Whoever rejects after this from you, then he has strayed from the path.</span>
<span class=verse id=s5v13 title="Surah 5, Verse 13">But because of them breaking their covenant, We have cursed them, and made their hearts become hardened; they take the words out of context; and they forgot much of what they were reminded of. And you will still discover betrayal in them except for a few; so pardon them and overlook; God loves the good doers.</span>
<span class=verse id=s5v14 title="Surah 5, Verse 14">And from those who have said: "We are Nazarenes," We have taken their covenant and they have forgotten much of what they were reminded of; so We planted between them animosity and hatred until the Day of Resurrection; and God will inform them of what they had done.</span>
<span class=verse id=s5v15 title="Surah 5, Verse 15">O people of the Book, Our messenger has come to you to clarify for you much of what you were hiding from the Book, and to pardon over much. A light has come to you from God and a clarifying Book.</span>
<span class=verse id=s5v16 title="Surah 5, Verse 16">God guides with it whoever follows His acceptance, to the ways of peace; and it brings them out of the darkness and into the light with His permission; and it guides them to a straight path.</span>
<span class=verse id=s5v17 title="Surah 5, Verse 17">Rejecters indeed are those who have said: "God is the Messiah, son of Mary." Say: "Who has any power against God if He had wanted to destroy the Messiah, son of Mary, and his mother, and all who are on the earth!" And to God is the sovereignty of the heavens and the earth and all that is in-between; He creates what He pleases. God is capable of all things.</span>
<span class=verse id=s5v18 title="Surah 5, Verse 18">And the Jews and the Nazarenes said: "We are the children of God, and His loved ones." Say: "Then why does He punish you for your sins?" No, you are merely mortals which He has created. He forgives whom He pleases, and He punishes whom He pleases. And to God is the sovereignty of the heavens and the earth and all that is in-between, and to Him is the destiny.</span>
<span class=verse id=s5v19 title="Surah 5, Verse 19">O people of the Book, Our messenger has come to clarify for you after a lack of messengers; so that you cannot say: "No bearer of good news or warner has come to us;" for a bearer of good news and a warner has come to you; and God is capable of all things.</span>
<span class=verse id=s5v20 title="Surah 5, Verse 20">And Moses said to his people: "My people, remember the grace of God upon you that he made among you prophets, and made you kings, and he gave you what He had not given any from the worlds."</span>
<span class=verse id=s5v21 title="Surah 5, Verse 21">"O my people, enter the holy land as God Has decreed for you, and do not turn your backs, or you will become losers."</span>
<span class=verse id=s5v22 title="Surah 5, Verse 22">They said: "O Moses, in it are a mighty people, and we will not enter it until they leave from it. So when they leave from it, then we will enter."</span>
<span class=verse id=s5v23 title="Surah 5, Verse 23">Two men from among those who were fearing, upon whom God had bestowed favor, said: "Enter upon them through the gate, if you enter it then you will be the victors; and put your trust in God if you are believers."</span>
<span class=verse id=s5v24 title="Surah 5, Verse 24">They said: "O Moses, we will never enter it  as long as they are in it, so go you and your Lord and fight, we will stay right here!"</span>
<span class=verse id=s5v25 title="Surah 5, Verse 25">He said: "My Lord, I do not possess except myself and my brother, so separate between us and between the wicked people."</span>
<span class=verse id=s5v26 title="Surah 5, Verse 26">He said: "Then it has become forbidden for them for forty years, and they will be lost in the land." Do not be sorrowful over the wicked people.</span>
<span class=verse id=s5v27 title="Surah 5, Verse 27">And recite to them the news of the two sons of Adam with truth. They had both made an offering, and it was accepted from one of them, and not accepted from the other. He said: "I will kill you!" He said: "God only accepts from the righteous."</span>
<span class=verse id=s5v28 title="Surah 5, Verse 28">"If you stretch your hand to kill me, I will not stretch my hand to kill you, for I fear God, Lord of the worlds."</span>
<span class=verse id=s5v29 title="Surah 5, Verse 29">"I want you to have both my sin and your own sin, and you will then be among the dwellers of the Fire. Such is the recompense of the wicked."</span>
<span class=verse id=s5v30 title="Surah 5, Verse 30">So he found it in himself to kill his brother; so he killed him. He thus became one of the losers.</span>
<span class=verse id=s5v31 title="Surah 5, Verse 31">So God sent forth a raven to scratch the land and show him how to deal with the body of his brother. He said: "Woe to me! Am I not even able to be like this raven and deal with the body of my brother?" So he became of those who regretted.</span>
<span class=verse id=s5v32 title="Surah 5, Verse 32">It is because of this that We have decreed for the Children of Israel: "Anyone who kills a person for other than murder, or corruption in the land; then it is as if he has killed all the people! And whoever spares a life, then it is as if he has given life to all the people." Our messengers had come to them with clarities, but many of them are, after this, still corrupting on the earth.</span>
<span class=verse id=s5v33 title="Surah 5, Verse 33">The recompense of those who fight God and His messenger, and seek to make corruption in the land, is that they will be killed or crucified or that their hands and feet be cut off from alternate sides or that they be banished from the land; that is a disgrace for them in this world and in the Hereafter they will have a great retribution.</span>
<span class=verse id=s5v34 title="Surah 5, Verse 34">Except for those who repent before you overpower them, then know that God is Forgiving, Merciful.</span>
<span class=verse id=s5v35 title="Surah 5, Verse 35">O you who believe, be aware of God and seek a way to Him, and strive in His cause; that you may succeed.</span>
<span class=verse id=s5v36 title="Surah 5, Verse 36">Those who have rejected, if they had all that is on the earth and the same again with it to ransom against the retribution of the Day of Resurrection, it will not be accepted from them; and they will have a painful retribution.</span>
<span class=verse id=s5v37 title="Surah 5, Verse 37">They want to exit from the Fire, but they can never exit from it; and they will have a permanent retribution.</span>
<span class=verse id=s5v38 title="Surah 5, Verse 38">As for the thief, both male and female, you shall cut from their resources " as a penalty for what they have earned " to be made an example of from God. God is Noble, Wise.</span>
<span class=verse id=s5v39 title="Surah 5, Verse 39">Whoever repents after his wrongdoing and amends, then God will accept his repentance. God is Forgiving, Merciful.</span>
<span class=verse id=s5v40 title="Surah 5, Verse 40">Did you not know that God possesses the sovereignty of the heavens and the earth. He punishes whom He wills and He forgives whom He wills; and God is capable of all things.</span>
<span class=verse id=s5v41 title="Surah 5, Verse 41">O messenger, do not be saddened by those who increase in disbelief from among those who said: "We believe" with their mouths while their hearts did not believe. And from among those who are Jewish, there are those who listened to lies; they listened to people who never came to you; they distort the words from their context, and they say: "If you are given this, then take it, but if you are given anything different, then beware!" And whoever God wants to test, then you will not possess anything for him against God. These are the ones whose hearts God did not want to cleanse; in this world they will have humiliation, and in the Hereafter they will have a great retribution.</span>
<span class=verse id=s5v42 title="Surah 5, Verse 42">They listen to lies, and consume money illicitly. If they come to you, then you may judge between them or turn away from them; and if you turn away from them then they cannot harm you in the least; and if you judge then judge between them with justice. God loves those who are just.</span>
<span class=verse id=s5v43 title="Surah 5, Verse 43">And how can they make you their judge when they have the Torah, in which there is the judgment of God; then they turn away after that. Those are not believers.</span>
<span class=verse id=s5v44 title="Surah 5, Verse 44">We have sent down the Torah, in it is a guidance and a light; the prophets who have submitted judged with it for those who are Jewish, and the Devotees, and the Priests, for what they were entrusted of the Book of God, and they were witness over. So do not be concerned with the people but be concerned with Me; and do not purchase with My revelations a cheap price. And whoever does not judge with what God has sent down, then these are the rejecters.</span>
<span class=verse id=s5v45 title="Surah 5, Verse 45">And We have decreed for them in it that a life for a life, and an eye for an eye, and a nose for a nose, and an ear for an ear, and a tooth for a tooth, and wounds to be similar; and whoever remits anything of it, then it will cancel sins for him. And whoever does not judge with what God has sent down, then these are the wicked.</span>
<span class=verse id=s5v46 title="Surah 5, Verse 46">And We sent in their footsteps Jesus, son of Mary, affirming what was between his hands of the Torah. And We gave him the Gospel, in it is a guidance and a light, and affirming what was between his hands of the Torah, and a guidance and a lesson for the righteous.</span>
<span class=verse id=s5v47 title="Surah 5, Verse 47">And let the people of the Gospel judge with what God has sent down in it. And whoever does not judge with what God has sent down, then these are the wicked.</span>
<span class=verse id=s5v48 title="Surah 5, Verse 48">And We have sent down to you the Book with the truth, affirming what is between your hands of the Book and superseding it. So judge between them by what God has sent down, and do not follow their desires from what has come to you of the truth. For each of you We have made laws, and a structure; and if God had willed, He would have made you all one nation, but He tests you with what He has given you; so race to do good. To God you will return all of you, and He will inform you regarding that in which you dispute.</span>
<span class=verse id=s5v49 title="Surah 5, Verse 49">And judge between them by what God has sent down, and do not follow their desires, and beware lest they divert you away from some of what God has sent down to you. If they turn away, then know that God wants to inflict them with some of their sins; and many of the people are wicked.</span>
<span class=verse id=s5v50 title="Surah 5, Verse 50">Is it the judgment of the days of ignorance that they seek? Who is better than God as a judge for a people who comprehend?</span>
<span class=verse id=s5v51 title="Surah 5, Verse 51">O you who believe, do not take the Jews and the Nazarenes as allies, for they are allies to one another; and whoever takes them as such from among you is one of them. God does not guide the wicked people.</span>
<span class=verse id=s5v52 title="Surah 5, Verse 52">You will see those who have a disease in their hearts hurrying to them, saying: "We are concerned that a disaster will befall us!" Perhaps God will bring a victory or a decree from Himself, then they will become regretful over what they had kept hidden within themselves.</span>
<span class=verse id=s5v53 title="Surah 5, Verse 53">And those who believe said: "Were these the ones who swore oaths by God that they are with you?" Their works have collapsed, and they have become losers.</span>
<span class=verse id=s5v54 title="Surah 5, Verse 54">O you who believe, whoever from among you turns away from His system, then God will bring a people whom He loves and they love Him; humble towards the believers, proud towards the rejecters; they strive in the cause of God and do not fear to be blamed by those who blame. This is the grace of God, He bestows it upon whom He wills; God is Encompassing, Knowledgeable.</span>
<span class=verse id=s5v55 title="Surah 5, Verse 55">For your supporter are God and His messenger and those who believe; they hold the contact prayer and contribute towards purification, and they kneel.</span>
<span class=verse id=s5v56 title="Surah 5, Verse 56">And whoever allies God and His messenger and those who believe; then the party of God are the ones who will be victorious.</span>
<span class=verse id=s5v57 title="Surah 5, Verse 57">O you who believe, do not take as allies those who have taken your system for mockery and play from among those who have been given the Book before you and the rejecters. And be aware of God if you are believers.</span>
<span class=verse id=s5v58 title="Surah 5, Verse 58">And if you call to the contact prayer, they take it for mockery and play. That is because they are a people who do not comprehend.</span>
<span class=verse id=s5v59 title="Surah 5, Verse 59">Say: "O people of the Book, do you hate us simply because we believe in God and in what was sent down to us and what was sent down before?" Alas, the majority of them are wicked.</span>
<span class=verse id=s5v60 title="Surah 5, Verse 60">Say: "Shall I inform you of worse than this as a punishment from God? Those whom God cursed and became angry at them, and He made from them apes and pigs and servants of evil. Those have a worse place and are more astray from the right path."</span>
<span class=verse id=s5v61 title="Surah 5, Verse 61">And if they come to you they say: "We believe," while they had entered in with rejection and went out with the same. God is aware of what they were hiding.</span>
<span class=verse id=s5v62 title="Surah 5, Verse 62">And you see many of them hasten to sin and transgression and consuming money illicitly. Miserable indeed is what they were doing.</span>
<span class=verse id=s5v63 title="Surah 5, Verse 63">If only the Devotees and Priests had prohibited them for speaking evil and consuming money illicitly. Miserable indeed is what they have done.</span>
<span class=verse id=s5v64 title="Surah 5, Verse 64">And the Jews said: "The hand of God is tied down!" Their hands will be tied down, and they will be cursed for what they have said. No, His hands are wide open spending as He wills. And for many of them, what has been sent down to you will increase them in rebellion and rejection; and We have cast between them animosity and hatred until the Day of Resurrection. Every time they ignite the fire of war, God puts it out; and they seek to make corruption in the land; and God does not love the corrupters.</span>
<span class=verse id=s5v65 title="Surah 5, Verse 65">And if the people of the Book only had believed and been aware, We would have cancelled for them their sins and admitted them to gardens of bliss.</span>
<span class=verse id=s5v66 title="Surah 5, Verse 66">And if they had upheld the Torah and the Gospel, and what was sent down to them from their Lord, they would have been rewarded from above them and from beneath their feet. From among them is a pious nation, but most of them only do evil.</span>
<span class=verse id=s5v67 title="Surah 5, Verse 67">O messenger, deliver what was sent down to you from your Lord, and if you do not then you have not delivered His message; and God will protect you from the people. And God does not guide the rejecting people.</span>
<span class=verse id=s5v68 title="Surah 5, Verse 68">Say: "O people of the Book, you are not upon anything until you uphold the Torah and the Gospel and what was sent down to you from your Lord." And for many of them, what was sent down to you from your Lord will only increase them in transgression and rejection. So do not feel sorry for the rejecting people.</span>
<span class=verse id=s5v69 title="Surah 5, Verse 69">Surely those who believe; and those who are Jewish, and the Sabians, and the Nazarenes, whoever of them believes in God and the Last Day and does good works; then they will have nothing to fear nor will they grieve.</span>
<span class=verse id=s5v70 title="Surah 5, Verse 70">We have taken the covenant of the Children of Israel and We sent to them Our messengers. Every time a messenger came to them with what their souls did not desire, a group of them they would reject, and a group of them they would kill.</span>
<span class=verse id=s5v71 title="Surah 5, Verse 71">And they did not consider it might be a test, so they were blind and deaf. But God would have accepted the repentance from them; but many of them were still blind and deaf. God is Seer over what they do.</span>
<span class=verse id=s5v72 title="Surah 5, Verse 72">Rejecters indeed are those who have said: "God is the Messiah, son of Mary." And the Messiah said: "O Children of Israel, serve God, my Lord and your Lord. Whoever sets up partners with God, then God will restrict Paradise from him, and his destiny will be the Fire; and the wicked will have no supporters."</span>
<span class=verse id=s5v73 title="Surah 5, Verse 73">Rejecters indeed are those who have said: "God is third of three!" There is no god except One god. If they do not cease from what they are saying, then those who reject from among them will be afflicted with a painful retribution.</span>
<span class=verse id=s5v74 title="Surah 5, Verse 74">Would they not repent to God and seek His forgiveness? God is Forgiving, Merciful.</span>
<span class=verse id=s5v75 title="Surah 5, Verse 75">The Messiah, son of Mary, is no more than a messenger; like whom messengers have passed away; and his mother was trustworthy, they used to eat the food. See how We clarify the signs for them, then see how they deviate.</span>
<span class=verse id=s5v76 title="Surah 5, Verse 76">Say: "Do you serve other than God what cannot harm you or benefit you?" God is the Hearer, the Knower.</span>

<span class=verse id=s5v80 title="Surah 5, Verse 80">You see many of them allying the rejecters. Wicked is what their souls have provided for them, for the wrath of God is upon them, and in the retribution they will abide.</span>

<span class=verse id=s6v1 title="Surah 6, Verse 1">Praise be to God who has created the heavens and the earth, and Who made the darkness and the light; yet those who have rejected their Lord continue to deviate.</span>
<span class=verse id=s6v2 title="Surah 6, Verse 2">He is the One who has created you from clay, then He decreed a period of time for you; a time only known by Him. Yet you still deny.</span>

<span class=verse id=s6v4 title="Surah 6, Verse 4">And every sign that came to them from their Lord, they turned away from it.</span>
<span class=verse id=s6v5 title="Surah 6, Verse 5">They have denied the truth when it came to them. The news will ultimately come to them of what they were mocking.</span>
<span class=verse id=s6v6 title="Surah 6, Verse 6">Did they not see how many generations We have destroyed before them? We granted them dominance over the land more than what We granted you, and We sent the sky to them abundantly, and We made rivers flow beneath them; then, We destroyed them for their sins, and established after them a new generation.</span>
<span class=verse id=s6v7 title="Surah 6, Verse 7">And if We had sent down to you a book already written on paper, and they touched it with their own hands, then those who have rejected would say: "This is but clear magic!"</span>
<span class=verse id=s6v8 title="Surah 6, Verse 8">And they said: "If only an angel were sent down to him?" But if We had sent down an angel, the matter would be settled, then they would no longer be respited.</span>
<span class=verse id=s6v9 title="Surah 6, Verse 9">And had We sent an angel, We would have made him appear as a man, and We would have confounded them in what they already are confounded.</span>
<span class=verse id=s6v10 title="Surah 6, Verse 10">Messengers before you were mocked, but those who ridiculed suffered the consequences of that which they mocked.</span>
<span class=verse id=s6v11 title="Surah 6, Verse 11">Say: "Roam the earth, then see what the punishment of the rejecters was!"</span>
<span class=verse id=s6v12 title="Surah 6, Verse 12">Say: "To whom is all that is in the heavens and the earth?" Say: "To God." He has decreed mercy on Himself, that He will gather you to the Day of Resurrection in which there is no doubt. Those who have lost their souls, they do not believe.</span>
<span class=verse id=s6v13 title="Surah 6, Verse 13">And for Him is what resides in the night and in the day; and He is the Hearer, the Knower.</span>
<span class=verse id=s6v14 title="Surah 6, Verse 14">Say: "Shall I take other than God as an ally; the initiator of the heavens and the earth; while He feeds and is not fed!" Say: "I have been commanded to be the first who submits." And do not be of the polytheists.</span>

<span class=verse id=s6v20 title="Surah 6, Verse 20">Those to whom We have given the Book know it as they know their children. Those who lost their souls, they do not believe.</span>
<span class=verse id=s6v21 title="Surah 6, Verse 21">And who is more wicked than he who invents lies about God, or denies His revelations! The wicked will never succeed.</span>
<span class=verse id=s6v22 title="Surah 6, Verse 22">And the Day We gather them all, then We say to the polytheists: "Where are your partners whom you used to claim?"</span>
<span class=verse id=s6v23 title="Surah 6, Verse 23">Then, their only excuse was to say: "By God, our Lord, we were not polytheists!"</span>
<span class=verse id=s6v24 title="Surah 6, Verse 24">See how they lied to themselves; and that which they invented abandoned them.</span>
<span class=verse id=s6v25 title="Surah 6, Verse 25">And from them are those who listen to you; and We have made covers over their hearts to prevent them from understanding it, and a deafness in their ears; and if they see every sign they will not believe; even when they come to you they argue, those who reject say: "This is nothing except fictional tales of old!"</span>
<span class=verse id=s6v26 title="Surah 6, Verse 26">And they prohibit others from it, and keep away themselves from it; but they will only destroy themselves, yet they do not notice.</span>
<span class=verse id=s6v27 title="Surah 6, Verse 27">And if you could see when they are standing over the Fire, they say: "If only we could be sent back, we would not deny the revelations of our Lord, and we would be believers!"</span>
<span class=verse id=s6v28 title="Surah 6, Verse 28">No, it is merely what they have been concealing that has now become evident to them; and if they were sent back they would  return again to what they were prohibited from, they are but liars!</span>
<span class=verse id=s6v29 title="Surah 6, Verse 29">And they had said: "There is only this worldly life, and we will not be resurrected!"</span>
<span class=verse id=s6v30 title="Surah 6, Verse 30">And if you could see them when they are standing at their Lord; He said: "Is this not the truth?" They said: "Yes, by our Lord," He said: "Then taste the retribution for what you have rejected."</span>
<span class=verse id=s6v31 title="Surah 6, Verse 31">Losers are those who have denied their meeting with God; until the Hour comes to them suddenly, then they say: "We deeply regret that which we have wasted in it," and they will carry their burdens on their backs; miserable indeed is their burden.</span>
<span class=verse id=s6v32 title="Surah 6, Verse 32">And the worldly life is nothing more than play and distraction, and the abode of the Hereafter is far better for those who are righteous. Do you not comprehend?</span>
<span class=verse id=s6v33 title="Surah 6, Verse 33">We know that you are saddened by what they say; they are not rejecting you, but it is the revelations of God which the wicked disregard.</span>
<span class=verse id=s6v34 title="Surah 6, Verse 34">Messengers before you were denied, but they were patient for what they were denied, and they were harmed until Our victory came to them; there is no changing the words of God. News of the messengers has come to you.</span>
<span class=verse id=s6v35 title="Surah 6, Verse 35">And if their aversion has become too much for you, then perhaps you could make a tunnel in the earth, or a ladder to the heavens, and bring them a sign. Had God willed, He would have gathered them to the guidance; so do not be of the ignorant ones.</span>
<span class=verse id=s6v36 title="Surah 6, Verse 36">Only those who listen will respond. As for the dead, God will resurrect them, then to Him they will return.</span>
<span class=verse id=s6v37 title="Surah 6, Verse 37">And they said: "If only a sign was sent to him from his Lord!" Say: "God is able to send a sign, but most of them would not know."</span>
<span class=verse id=s6v38 title="Surah 6, Verse 38">And there is not a creature on the earth, nor a bird that flies with its wings, except they belong to nations like you belong. We did not leave anything out of the record; then to their Lord they will be gathered.</span>
<span class=verse id=s6v39 title="Surah 6, Verse 39">And those who deny Our revelations, they are deaf and dumb, in darkness. Whoever God wishes He misguides, and whoever He wishes He puts him on a straight path.</span>
<span class=verse id=s6v40 title="Surah 6, Verse 40">Say: "We will see when the retribution of God comes to you, or the Hour comes to you, if you will still call on any other than God. If you are being truthful."</span>
<span class=verse id=s6v41 title="Surah 6, Verse 41">"No, it is Him alone you will call on; and He will remove that which you called Him for, if He wills; and you will forget what you set up."</span>
<span class=verse id=s6v42 title="Surah 6, Verse 42">And We have sent others to nations before you. We then took them with adversity and hardship, perhaps they would implore.</span>
<span class=verse id=s6v43 title="Surah 6, Verse 43">If only they had implored when Our punishment came to them; but their hearts hardened, and the devil adorned for them what they used to do.</span>
<span class=verse id=s6v44 title="Surah 6, Verse 44">So when they forgot what they had been reminded of, We opened for them the gates of all opportunities; and when they were happy with what they were given, We took them suddenly! They were confounded.</span>
<span class=verse id=s6v45 title="Surah 6, Verse 45">It was thus that the remainder of the wicked people were wiped out; and praise be to God, Lord of the worlds.</span>
<span class=verse id=s6v46 title="Surah 6, Verse 46">Say: "Do you see that if God were to take away your hearing and your eyesight, and He seals your hearts; which god besides God can bring it to you?" See how We dispatch the signs, but then they turn away.</span>
<span class=verse id=s6v47 title="Surah 6, Verse 47">Say: "Do you see if the retribution of God comes to you suddenly, or gradually, will anyone be destroyed except the wicked people?"</span>
<span class=verse id=s6v48 title="Surah 6, Verse 48">And We do not send the messengers except as bearers of good news and warners; whoever believes, and does good, then there is no fear for them nor will they grieve.</span>
<span class=verse id=s6v49 title="Surah 6, Verse 49">And those who deny Our revelations, the retribution will inflict them for what wickedness they were in.</span>
<span class=verse id=s6v50 title="Surah 6, Verse 50">Say: "I do not say to you that I possess the treasures of God, nor do I know the future, nor do I say to you that I am an angel. I merely follow what is inspired to me." Say: "Are the blind and the seer the same? Do you not think?"</span>
<span class=verse id=s6v51 title="Surah 6, Verse 51">And warn with it those who realize that they will be gathered to their Lord; they do not have besides Him any ally nor intercessor; perhaps they will be righteous.</span>
<span class=verse id=s6v52 title="Surah 6, Verse 52">And do not turn away those who call on their Lord at dawn and dusk seeking His face; you are not responsible for their judgment, nor are they responsible for your judgment; if you turn them away, then you will be of the wicked.</span>
<span class=verse id=s6v53 title="Surah 6, Verse 53">And it is such that We test them with one another, so that they may say: "Are these the ones whom God has blessed from among us?" Is God not aware of the thankful?</span>
<span class=verse id=s6v54 title="Surah 6, Verse 54">And if those who believe in Our revelations come to you, then say: "Peace be upon you, our Lord has decreed mercy upon Himself, that any of you who commits sin out of ignorance and then repents afterwards and amends, then He is Forgiving, Merciful."</span>
<span class=verse id=s6v55 title="Surah 6, Verse 55">And it is such that We explain the revelations, and point out the way of the criminals.</span>
<span class=verse id=s6v56 title="Surah 6, Verse 56">Say: "I am prohibited from serving those you call upon other than God" Say: "I will not follow your desires, otherwise I would go astray and I would not be of those guided."</span>
<span class=verse id=s6v57 title="Surah 6, Verse 57">Say: "I am on a clarity from my Lord and you have denied it. I do not have what you hasten towards; the judgment is with God only; He narrates the truth, and He is the best decider."</span>
<span class=verse id=s6v58 title="Surah 6, Verse 58">Say: "If I had what you were hastening towards, then the matter between us would have been resolved. And God is fully aware of the wicked."</span>
<span class=verse id=s6v59 title="Surah 6, Verse 59">And with Him are the keys of the unseen, none know them except He. And He knows what is in the land and in the sea; and not a leaf falls except He knows of it; nor a seed in the darkness of the earth; nor anything moist or anything dry; all in a clear record.</span>
<span class=verse id=s6v60 title="Surah 6, Verse 60">And He is the One who seizes you during the night, and He knows what you have done during the day, then He sends you back again to complete an appointed term; then to Him is your return and He will inform you of what you used to do.</span>
<span class=verse id=s6v61 title="Surah 6, Verse 61">And He is the Supreme over His servants, and He sends over you guardians. So that when the time of death comes to one of you, Our messengers terminate his life, and they do not neglect any.</span>
<span class=verse id=s6v62 title="Surah 6, Verse 62">Then they are returned to God, their true Patron; to Him is the judgment and He is the swiftest of reckoners.</span>
<span class=verse id=s6v63 title="Surah 6, Verse 63">Say: "Who rescues you from the darkness of the land and the sea?" You call on Him in humility and in secret: "If You save us from this, we will be of the thankful!"</span>
<span class=verse id=s6v64 title="Surah 6, Verse 64">Say: "God will save you from it and from all distresses, yet you will still set up partners!"</span>
<span class=verse id=s6v65 title="Surah 6, Verse 65">Say: "He is able to send retribution from above you or from below your feet, or He will make you belong to opposing factions, then He will let you taste the might of each other." See how We dispatch the signs, perhaps they may understand.</span>
<span class=verse id=s6v66 title="Surah 6, Verse 66">And your people denied it, while it is the truth. Say: "I am not a guardian over you!"</span>
<span class=verse id=s6v67 title="Surah 6, Verse 67">"For every news there is a time, and you will come to know."</span>
<span class=verse id=s6v68 title="Surah 6, Verse 68">And if you encounter those who make fun of Our revelations, then turn away from them until they move on to a different narrative; and if the devil makes you forget, then do not sit after remembering with the wicked people.</span>
<span class=verse id=s6v69 title="Surah 6, Verse 69">And those who are righteous are not responsible for their judgement, but to remind; perhaps they will be aware.</span>
<span class=verse id=s6v70 title="Surah 6, Verse 70">Leave alone those who have taken their system for play and distraction, and this worldly life has tempted them.

Say: "Is it the two males that He forbade or the two females, or what the wombs of the two females bore? Or were you witnesses when God ordered you with this?"

<span class=verse id=s8v52 title="Surah 8, Verse 52">Like the behavior of the people of Pharaoh, and those before them; they rejected the signs of God, so God took them by their sins. God is Strong, severe in punishment.</span>
<span class=verse id=s8v53 title="Surah 8, Verse 53">That is because God was not to change any blessing He bestowed upon a people, unless they change what is in themselves. God is Hearer, Knowledgeable.</span>
<span class=verse id=s8v54 title="Surah 8, Verse 54">Like the behavior of the people of Pharaoh, and those before them; they denied the signs of their Lord, so We destroyed them by their sins, and We drowned the people of Pharaoh; all of them were wicked.</span>
<span class=verse id=s8v55 title="Surah 8, Verse 55">The worst creatures to God are those who reject, for they do not believe.</span>
<span class=verse id=s8v56 title="Surah 8, Verse 56">Those of them with whom you made a pledge, then they break their pledge every time, and they do take heed.</span>
<span class=verse id=s8v57 title="Surah 8, Verse 57">So, when you encounter them in battle, set them as an example for those who will come after them; perhaps they may remember.</span>
<span class=verse id=s8v58 title="Surah 8, Verse 58">And if you are being betrayed by a people, then you shall likewise move against them. God does not love the betrayers.</span>
<span class=verse id=s8v59 title="Surah 8, Verse 59">And let not those who have rejected think that they have escaped; they will never avail themselves.</span>
<span class=verse id=s8v60 title="Surah 8, Verse 60">And prepare for them all that you can of might, and from the steeds of war, that you may instill terror with it towards the enemy of God and your enemy, and others besides them whom you do not know but God knows them. And whatever you spend in the cause of God will be returned to you, and you will not be wronged.</span>
<span class=verse id=s8v61 title="Surah 8, Verse 61">And if they seek peace, then you also seek it, and put your trust in God. He is the Hearer, the Knowledgeable.</span>
<span class=verse id=s8v62 title="Surah 8, Verse 62">And if they wish to deceive you, then God is sufficient for you. He is the One who supported you with His victory and with the believers.</span>
<span class=verse id=s8v63 title="Surah 8, Verse 63">And He made unity between their hearts. And if you had spent all that is on the earth, you would not have united between their hearts, but God united between them. He is Noble, Wise.</span>
<span class=verse id=s8v64 title="Surah 8, Verse 64">O prophet, God is sufficient for you,  and whoever followed you from the believers.</span>
<span class=verse id=s8v65 title="Surah 8, Verse 65">O prophet, urge the believers to fight. If there are twenty of you who are patient, they will defeat two hundred. And if there are one hundred of you, they will defeat one thousand from among those who reject; that is because they are a people who do not understand.</span>
<span class=verse id=s8v66 title="Surah 8, Verse 66">Now, God has alleviated for you, for He knows that there is weakness in you. If there are one hundred of you who are patient, they will defeat two hundred. And if there are one thousand of you, they will defeat two thousand with the permission of God. God is with the patient.</span>
<span class=verse id=s8v67 title="Surah 8, Verse 67">And it was not for any prophet to take prisoners until he is bound by a campaign. You desire the materials of this world, while God wants the Hereafter for you. God is Noble, Wise.</span>
<span class=verse id=s8v68 title="Surah 8, Verse 68">Had it not been previously ordained from God, then a severe punishment would have afflicted you for what you took.</span>
<span class=verse id=s8v69 title="Surah 8, Verse 69">So consume what you have gained, lawful and good, and be aware of God. God is Forgiving, Merciful.</span>
<span class=verse id=s8v70 title="Surah 8, Verse 70">O prophet, say to those prisoners whom you hold: "If God finds in your hearts any good, He will grant you better than what He took from you, and He will forgive you. God is Forgiving, Merciful."</span>

<span class=verse id=s8v72 title="Surah 8, Verse 72">Those who have believed and emigrated and strived with their money and lives in the cause of God, and those who have sheltered and supported; these are the allies of one another. And those who believed but did not emigrate, you do not owe them any obligation until they emigrate.

<span class=verse id=s8v73 title="Surah 8, Verse 73">As for those who reject, they are allies to one another. If you do not do this, then there will be oppression on the earth and great corruption.</span>
<span class=verse id=s8v74 title="Surah 8, Verse 74">And those who have believed and emigrated and strived in the cause of God, and those who have sheltered and supported, these are truly the believers. They will have a forgiveness and a generous provision.</span>
<span class=verse id=s8v75 title="Surah 8, Verse 75">And those who believed afterwards and emigrated and strived with you, then they are from you. And the relatives by birth are also supportive of one another in the Book of God. God is aware of all things.</span>

<span class=verse id=s9v1 title="Surah 9, Verse 1">A revocation is made by God and His messenger to those with whom you have made a pledge from among the polytheists.</span>
<span class=verse id=s9v2 title="Surah 9, Verse 2">"Therefore, roam the land for four months and know that you will not escape God, and that God will humiliate the rejecters."</span>
<span class=verse id=s9v3 title="Surah 9, Verse 3">And a proclamation from God and His messenger to the people, on the day of the greater Pilgrimage: "That God and His messenger are innocent from the polytheists." If you repent, then it is better for you, and if you turn away, then know that you will not escape God. And give news to those who have rejected of a painful retribution.</span>
<span class=verse id=s9v4 title="Surah 9, Verse 4">Except for those with whom you had made a pledge from among the polytheists if they did not reduce anything from it nor did they support anyone against you; you shall continue the pledge with them until its expiry. God loves the righteous.</span>
<span class=verse id=s9v5 title="Surah 9, Verse 5">So when the restricted months have passed, then you may kill the polytheists wherever you find them, and take them, and surround them, and stand against them at every point. If they repent, and they hold the contact prayer, and they contribute towards purification, then you shall leave them alone. God is Forgiving, Merciful.</span>
<span class=verse id=s9v6 title="Surah 9, Verse 6">And if any of the polytheists seeks your protection, then you may protect him so that he may hear the words of God, then let him reach his sanctity. This is because they are a people who do not know.</span>
<span class=verse id=s9v7 title="Surah 9, Verse 7">How can the polytheists have a pledge with God and with His messenger? Except for those with whom you made a pledge near the Restricted Temple, as long as they are upright with you, then you are upright with them. God loves the righteous.</span>
<span class=verse id=s9v8 title="Surah 9, Verse 8">How is it that when they come upon you they disregard all ties, either those of kinship or of pledge. They seek to please you with their words, but their hearts deny, and the majority of them are wicked.</span>
<span class=verse id=s9v9 title="Surah 9, Verse 9">They purchased with the revelations of God a cheap price, so they repel others from His path. Evil indeed is what they used to do.</span>
<span class=verse id=s9v10 title="Surah 9, Verse 10">They do not respect those who are believers, nor a kinship, nor a pledge. These are the transgressors.</span>
<span class=verse id=s9v11 title="Surah 9, Verse 11">If they repent, and they hold the contact prayer, and they contribute towards purification, then they are your brothers in the system. We explain the revelations for a people who know.</span>
<span class=verse id=s9v12 title="Surah 9, Verse 12">And if they break their oaths after making their pledge, and they challenge the authority of your system; then you may kill the leaders of rejection. Their oaths are nothing to them, perhaps they will then cease.</span>
<span class=verse id=s9v13 title="Surah 9, Verse 13">Would you not fight a people who broke their oaths, and obsessed to expel the messenger, especially while they were the ones who attacked you first? Are you concerned about them? It is God who is more deserving that you be concerned with if you are believers.</span>
<span class=verse id=s9v14 title="Surah 9, Verse 14">Fight them; perhaps God will punish them by your hands and humiliate them and grant you victory over them and heal the chests of the believing people.</span>
<span class=verse id=s9v15 title="Surah 9, Verse 15">And to remove the anger from their hearts; God pardons whom he pleases. God is Knowledgeable, Wise.</span>
<span class=verse id=s9v16 title="Surah 9, Verse 16">Or did you think that you would be left alone? God will come to distinguish those of you who strived and did not take other than God and His messenger and the believers as helpers. God is Expert in what you do.</span>
<span class=verse id=s9v17 title="Surah 9, Verse 17">It was not for the polytheists to maintain the temples of God while they bear witness over their own rejection. For these, their works have fallen, and in the Fire they will abide.</span>
<span class=verse id=s9v18 title="Surah 9, Verse 18">Rather, the temples of God are maintained by he who believes in God and the Last Day, and he upholds the contact prayer, and he contributes towards purification, and is only concerned by God. It is these that will be of the guided ones.</span>
<span class=verse id=s9v19 title="Surah 9, Verse 19">Have you made the watering of the pilgrim and the maintenance of the Restricted Temple the same as one who believes in God and the Last Day and he strives in the cause of God? They are not the same with God. And God does not guide the wicked people.</span>
<span class=verse id=s9v20 title="Surah 9, Verse 20">Those who believed and emigrated and strived in the cause of God with their money and their lives are in a greater degree with God. These are the winners.</span>
<span class=verse id=s9v21 title="Surah 9, Verse 21">Their Lord gives them good news of a mercy from Him, and acceptance, and gardens that are for them in which there is permanent bliss.</span>
<span class=verse id=s9v22 title="Surah 9, Verse 22">They will abide in it eternally. With God there is a great reward.</span>
<span class=verse id=s9v23 title="Surah 9, Verse 23">O you who believe, do not take your fathers nor brothers as allies if they prefer rejection to belief. And whoever of you takes them as such, then these are the wicked.</span>
<span class=verse id=s9v24 title="Surah 9, Verse 24">Say: "If your fathers, and your sons, and your brothers, and your wives, and your kin, and money which you have gathered, and a trade which you would be concerned over its decline, and homes which you find pleasing; if these are dearer to you than God and His messenger and striving in His cause, then wait until God brings His decision. And God does not guide the wicked people."</span>
<span class=verse id=s9v25 title="Surah 9, Verse 25">God has granted you victory in many battlefields. And on the day of Hunayn when you were pleased with your great numbers but it did not help you at all, and the land became tight around you for what it held, then you turned to flee.</span>
<span class=verse id=s9v26 title="Surah 9, Verse 26">Then God sent down His tranquility upon His messenger and the believers, and He sent down soldiers which you did not see, and He punished those who rejected. Such is the recompense of the rejecters.</span>
<span class=verse id=s9v27 title="Surah 9, Verse 27">Then God will accept the repentance of whom He pleases after that. God is Forgiving, Merciful.</span>
<span class=verse id=s9v28 title="Surah 9, Verse 28">O you who believe, the polytheists are impure, so let them not approach the Restricted Temple after this calendar year of theirs; and if you fear poverty, then God will enrich you from His blessings if He wills. God is Knowledgeable, Wise.</span>
<span class=verse id=s9v29 title="Surah 9, Verse 29">Fight those who do not believe in God or the Last Day, nor do they forbid what God and His messenger have forbidden, nor do they uphold the system of truth; from among the people who have been given the Book; until they pay the reparation, willingly or unwillingly, and they are subdued.</span>
<span class=verse id=s9v30 title="Surah 9, Verse 30">The Jews said: "Ezra is the son of God," and the Nazarenes said: "The Messiah is the son of God." Such is their utterances with their mouths, they imitate the sayings of those who rejected before them. God will fight them. They are deluded from the truth!</span>
<span class=verse id=s9v31 title="Surah 9, Verse 31">They have taken their Priests and Monks to be patrons besides God, and the Messiah, son of Mary, while they were only commanded to serve One god, there is no god except He, be He glorified against what they set up.</span>
<span class=verse id=s9v32 title="Surah 9, Verse 32">They want to extinguish the light of God with their mouths, but God refuses such and lets His light continue, even if the rejecters hate it.</span>
<span class=verse id=s9v33 title="Surah 9, Verse 33">He is the One who has sent His messenger with the guidance and the system of truth, so that it will expose all other systems, even if the polytheists hate it.</span>
<span class=verse id=s9v34 title="Surah 9, Verse 34">O you who believe, many of the Priests and Monks consume the money of the people in falsehood, and they repel from the path of God. And those who hoard gold and silver, and do not spend it in the cause of God, give them news of a painful retribution.</span>
<span class=verse id=s9v35 title="Surah 9, Verse 35">On the Day when it will be heated in the fire of Hell, and their foreheads and sides and backs will be branded with it: "This is what you have hoarded for yourselves, so taste what you have hoarded!"</span>
<span class=verse id=s9v36 title="Surah 9, Verse 36">The count of the months with God is twelve months in the book of God the day He created the heavens and the earth; four of them are restricted. This is the correct system; so do not wrong yourselves in them; and fight the polytheists collectively as they fight you collectively. And know that God is with the righteous.</span>
<span class=verse id=s9v37 title="Surah 9, Verse 37">From the use of the intercalary month comes an addition to rejection; that those who have rejected are misguided by it. They make it lawful one calendar year, and forbidden one calendar year, so as to circumvent the count of what God has made restricted; thus they make lawful what God has made forbidden. Their evil works have been adorned for them, and God does not guide the rejecting people.</span>
<span class=verse id=s9v38 title="Surah 9, Verse 38">O you who believe, what is wrong with you when you are told: "Mobilize in the cause of God," you become heavy on the earth. Have you become content with this worldly life over the Hereafter? The enjoyment of this worldly life compared to the Hereafter is nothing.</span>
<span class=verse id=s9v39 title="Surah 9, Verse 39">If you do not mobilize, then He will punish you with a painful retribution, and He will replace you with another people, and you do not bother Him in the least. God is capable of all things.</span>
<span class=verse id=s9v40 title="Surah 9, Verse 40">If you do not help him, then God has helped him. When those who rejected expelled him, he was one of only two, and when they were in the cave, he said to his friend: "Do not grieve, for God is with us." So God sent down His tranquility over him and He supported him with soldiers that you did not see, and He made the word of those who rejected be the lowest, and the word of God be the highest. God is Noble, Wise.</span>
<span class=verse id=s9v41 title="Surah 9, Verse 41">Mobilize in light gear or heavy gear, and strive with your money and lives in the cause of God. That is best if only you knew.</span>
<span class=verse id=s9v42 title="Surah 9, Verse 42">If it were a near gain, or an easy journey, they would have followed you; but the distance was too much for them. And they will swear by God: "If we could have, we would have gone with you." They destroy themselves, and God knows they are liars.</span>
<span class=verse id=s9v43 title="Surah 9, Verse 43">God pardons you; why did you give them leave before it became clear to you who are truthful, and who are lying?</span>
<span class=verse id=s9v44 title="Surah 9, Verse 44">Those who believe in God and the Last Day will not ask leave. They strive with their money and their lives. And God is aware of the righteous.</span>
<span class=verse id=s9v45 title="Surah 9, Verse 45">Those who ask leave are the ones who do not believe in God and the Last Day, and their hearts are in doubt. In their doubts they are wavering.</span>
<span class=verse id=s9v46 title="Surah 9, Verse 46">And if they had wanted to go then they would have taken all precautions for it, but God disliked them coming forth, so He made them lag behind, and they were told: "Stay with those who have stayed."</span>
<span class=verse id=s9v47 title="Surah 9, Verse 47">Had they gone with you they would have added nothing except disruption, and they would have hurried about seeking to cause for you an ordeal; and there are some among you who listen to them. God is aware of the wicked.</span>
<span class=verse id=s9v48 title="Surah 9, Verse 48">They wanted to cause an ordeal from before, and they turned matters upside down for you until the truth came and the command of God was revealed, while they hated it.</span>
<span class=verse id=s9v49 title="Surah 9, Verse 49">And from them are those who say: "Grant me leave, and do not test me." But it is in the test that they have indeed fallen, and Hell is surrounding the rejecters.</span>
<span class=verse id=s9v50 title="Surah 9, Verse 50">When any good befalls you, it upsets them, and if any bad befalls you, they say: "We have taken our precaution beforehand," and they turn away happy.</span>
<span class=verse id=s9v51 title="Surah 9, Verse 51">Say: "Nothing will befall us except what God has decreed for us, He is our Patron." And in God the believers shall put their trust.</span>
<span class=verse id=s9v52 title="Surah 9, Verse 52">Say: "You can only expect for us one of two good things; while we wait for you to be afflicted by God with a retribution from Him, or by our hands. So wait, we are with you waiting."</span>
<span class=verse id=s9v53 title="Surah 9, Verse 53">Say: "Spend willingly or unwillingly, it will not be accepted from you. You are a wicked people."</span>
<span class=verse id=s9v54 title="Surah 9, Verse 54">And what prevented what they would spend from being accepted from them except that they rejected God and His messenger, and they do not attend the contact prayer except lazily, and they do not spend except unwillingly.</span>
<span class=verse id=s9v55 title="Surah 9, Verse 55">So do not be impressed by their wealth or children; God only wishes to punish them with it in the worldly life, and so that their souls will be taken while they are rejecters.</span>
<span class=verse id=s9v56 title="Surah 9, Verse 56">And they swear by God that they are with you, while they are not with you; but they are a people who are indecisive.</span>
<span class=verse id=s9v57 title="Surah 9, Verse 57">If they find a refuge, or cave, or any place to enter, they will run to it while they are in haste.</span>
<span class=verse id=s9v58 title="Surah 9, Verse 58">And from them are those who criticize you regarding the charities. If they are given from it, they are content; and if they are not given from it, they become enraged!</span>
<span class=verse id=s9v59 title="Surah 9, Verse 59">And if they had only been content with what God and His messenger had given them, and they had said: "God suffices; God will give us from His bounty, and His messenger; it is towards God that we desire."</span>
<span class=verse id=s9v60 title="Surah 9, Verse 60">Indeed, the charities are for the poor, and the needy, and those who work to collect them, and those whose hearts have been united, and to free the slaves, and those in debt, and in the cause of God, and the wayfarer. A duty from God, and God is Knowledgeable, Wise.</span>
<span class=verse id=s9v61 title="Surah 9, Verse 61">And from them are those who harm the prophet, and they say: "He only listens!" Say: "What he listens to is best for you. He believes in God, and he has trust for the believers, and he is a mercy to those who believe among you." And those who harm the messenger of God will have a painful retribution.</span>
<span class=verse id=s9v62 title="Surah 9, Verse 62">They swear to you by God in order to please you; while God and His messenger are more worthy to be pleased if they are believers.</span>
<span class=verse id=s9v63 title="Surah 9, Verse 63">Did they not know that whoever is hostile towards God and His messenger, he will have the fire of Hell, abiding therein. Such is the greatest humiliation.</span>
<span class=verse id=s9v64 title="Surah 9, Verse 64">The hypocrites fear that a Chapter will be sent down which will expose what is in their hearts. Say: "Mock, for God will bring out what you fear."</span>
<span class=verse id=s9v65 title="Surah 9, Verse 65">And if you ask them they say: "We were only jesting and playing." Say: "In God and His revelations and His messenger you were mocking?"</span>
<span class=verse id=s9v66 title="Surah 9, Verse 66">Do not apologize, for you have rejected after your belief. If We pardon one group from you, We will punish another group. That is because they were criminals.</span>
<span class=verse id=s9v67 title="Surah 9, Verse 67">The hypocrite males and the hypocrite females, they are to each other. They order vice and prohibit good, and they close their hands. They forgot God, so He will forget them; indeed, the hypocrites are the wicked.</span>
<span class=verse id=s9v68 title="Surah 9, Verse 68">God has promised the hypocrite males and the hypocrite females and the rejecters a Fire in Hell, in it they will abide; it will be enough for them. And God has cursed them and they will have a lasting retribution.</span>
<span class=verse id=s9v69 title="Surah 9, Verse 69">Like those before them, they were more powerful than you, and with more wealth and children. They enjoyed their lives, and you enjoyed your lives as those before you enjoyed their lives; and you jested as they jested. They had their works crumble in this world and the next, and they were the losers.</span>
<span class=verse id=s9v70 title="Surah 9, Verse 70">Did the news not come to them of those before them, the people of Noah and 'Aad and Thamud. And the people of Abraham, and the dwellers of Midyan, and those overthrown. Their messengers came to them with clarity; it was not God who wronged them, but it was themselves that they wronged.</span>
<span class=verse id=s9v71 title="Surah 9, Verse 71">And the believing males and the believing females, they are allies to one another. They order good and prohibit vice, and they hold the contact prayer, and they contribute towards purification and they obey God and His messenger. God will have mercy on them; God is Noble, Wise.</span>
<span class=verse id=s9v72 title="Surah 9, Verse 72">God has promised the believing males and the believing females estates with rivers flowing beneath them, abiding therein, and pleasing homes in gardens of delight. And the acceptance from God is the most important; such is the great triumph.</span>
<span class=verse id=s9v73 title="Surah 9, Verse 73">O prophet, strive against the rejecters and the hypocrites and be firm against them. Their dwelling is Hell, what a miserable destiny!</span>
<span class=verse id=s9v74 title="Surah 9, Verse 74">They swear by God that they did not say it, while they had said the word of rejection, and they rejected after they had submitted, and they were obsessed with what they could not possess; and they could not find any fault except that God and His messenger had enriched them from His bounty. If they repent it is better for them, and if they turn away, then God will punish them severely in this world and the next. They will not have on the earth any ally or supporter.</span>
<span class=verse id=s9v75 title="Surah 9, Verse 75">And from them are those who pledged to God: "If He gives us from His bounty, then we will believe and we will be among the upright."</span>
<span class=verse id=s9v76 title="Surah 9, Verse 76">So when He gave them from His bounty, they became stingy with it, and they turned away while they were averse.</span>
<span class=verse id=s9v77 title="Surah 9, Verse 77">Thus, hypocrisy follows in their hearts until the Day they meet Him; that is for breaking what they promised God, and for what they were lying.</span>
<span class=verse id=s9v78 title="Surah 9, Verse 78">Did they not know that God knows their secrets, and their private counsel, and that God is the Knower of all the unseen?</span>
<span class=verse id=s9v79 title="Surah 9, Verse 79">Those who criticize the volunteers among the believers in charities; that they only have their efforts to give; so they mock them. God mocks them, and they will have a painful retribution.</span>
<span class=verse id=s9v80 title="Surah 9, Verse 80">Whether you seek forgiveness for them, or do not seek forgiveness for them. If you seek forgiveness for them seventy times, God will not forgive them. That is because they have rejected God and His messenger; and God does not guide the wicked people.</span>
<span class=verse id=s9v81 title="Surah 9, Verse 81">Those who have remained are happy with their position of lagging behind the messenger of God, and they disliked striving with their money and lives in the cause of God; and they say: "Do not mobilize in the heat." Say: "The fire of Hell is much hotter," if they could only understand.</span>
<span class=verse id=s9v82 title="Surah 9, Verse 82">Let them laugh a little, and cry a lot, a recompense for what they have earned.</span>
<span class=verse id=s9v83 title="Surah 9, Verse 83">So, if God sends you back to a group of them, and they ask your permission to come with you, then say: "You will not come with me ever; nor will you fight any enemy with me. You had accepted staying behind the first time, so stay with those who remain behind."</span>
<span class=verse id=s9v84 title="Surah 9, Verse 84">And do not make the contact prayer for any of them who have died, nor stand at their grave. They have rejected God and His messenger and died while they were wicked.</span>
<span class=verse id=s9v85 title="Surah 9, Verse 85">And do not be impressed by their wealth and their children; God only wishes to punish them with it in this world, and so their souls will be taken while they are rejecters.</span>
<span class=verse id=s9v86 title="Surah 9, Verse 86">And if a Chapter is sent down: "That you shall believe in God and strive with His messenger," those with wealth and influence ask your leave and they say: "Let us be with those who remain behind."</span>
<span class=verse id=s9v87 title="Surah 9, Verse 87">They were content to stay with those who remained behind, and it was imprinted on their hearts, for they do not understand.</span>
<span class=verse id=s9v88 title="Surah 9, Verse 88">But the messenger and those who believe with him have strived with their money and their lives. For them will be the good things, and they are the successful ones.</span>

<span class=verse id=s10v3 title="Surah 10, Verse 3">Your Lord is God who has created the heavens and the earth in six days, then He settled upon the Throne; He manages all affairs.

<span class=verse id=s10v4 title="Surah 10, Verse 4">To Him is your return, all of you, for the promise of God is true. He initiates the creation then He returns it; to recompense with justice those who have believed and have done good works.

<span class=verse id=s10v5 title="Surah 10, Verse 5">He is the One who has made the sun a radiance, and the moon a light, and He has measured its phases; that you may know the number of the years and the count.

<span class=verse id=s10v6 title="Surah 10, Verse 6">In the difference between the night and the day and what God has created in the heavens and the earth are signs for a people who are aware.</span>
<span class=verse id=s10v7 title="Surah 10, Verse 7">As for those who do not wish to meet Us, and they are content with the worldly life, and they feel secure by it, and they are unaware of Our signs.</span>

<span class=verse id=s10v11 title="Surah 10, Verse 11">And if God hastened for the people the evil as He hastens for them the good, then they would have been ruined. We thus leave those who do not wish to meet Us wandering in their transgression.</span>

But when We remove his hardship from him, he carries on as if he never called upon Us for a hardship which touched him! Thus it was made to appear good to the transgressors what they had done.</span>
<span class=verse id=s10v13 title="Surah 10, Verse 13">And We have destroyed the generations before you when they transgressed; and their messengers had come to them with clear proofs, but they would not believe. It is such that We recompense the criminal people.</span>

<span class=verse id=s10v16 title="Surah 10, Verse 16">Say: "If God had willed, I would not have recited it to you, nor would you have known about it. I have been residing among you for nearly a lifetime before this; do you not comprehend?"</span>

<span class=verse id=s10v19 title="Surah 10, Verse 19">The people were but one nation, then they differed. And had it not been for a previous command from your Lord, the matter would have been immediately judged between them for what they differed.</span>
<span class=verse id=s10v20 title="Surah 10, Verse 20">And they say: "If only a sign was sent down to him from His Lord." Say: "The future is with God, so wait, and I will wait with you."</span>
<span class=verse id=s10v21 title="Surah 10, Verse 21">And if We let the people taste a mercy after some hardship had afflicted them, they take to scheming against Our revelations! Say: "God is faster in scheming;" Our messengers record what you scheme.</span>
<span class=verse id=s10v22 title="Surah 10, Verse 22">He is the One who carries you on land and on the sea. And when you are on the ships and We drive them with a good wind which they rejoice with, a strong gust comes to them and the waves come to them from all sides, and they think that they are finished, they implore God with loyalty and devotion to His system: "If You save us from this, we will be of the thankful."</span>
<span class=verse id=s10v23 title="Surah 10, Verse 23">But when He saves them, they then traverse through the land with injustice. "O people, what you seek out is only the luxury of this worldly life, then to Us is your return and We will inform you of all that you had done."</span>
<span class=verse id=s10v24 title="Surah 10, Verse 24">The example of the worldly life is like a water which has come down from the sky, so it mixed with the plants of the earth from what the people and the livestock eat. Then the earth takes its shape and becomes beautiful and its inhabitants think that they have mastered it; then Our judgment comes by night or by day, so We make it a wasteland as if it never prospered by the yesterday! It is such that We clarify the revelations for a people who think.</span>
<span class=verse id=s10v25 title="Surah 10, Verse 25">God calls to the abode of peace, and He guides those whom He wishes to a straight path.</span>

<span class=verse id=s10v27 title="Surah 10, Verse 27">As for those who earn evil, the recompense of evil will be evil like it, and they will be humiliated. They do not have anyone to help them from God. It is as if their faces have been covered by a piece of darkness from the night. These are the people of the Fire, in it they will abide.</span>
<span class=verse id=s10v28 title="Surah 10, Verse 28">And on the Day We gather them all, then We will say to those who were polytheists: "Stop where you are, you and your partners," then We will separate between them, and their partners will say: "It was not us that you served!"</span>
<span class=verse id=s10v29 title="Surah 10, Verse 29">"God is enough as a witness between us and you, that we were unaware of you serving us."</span>
<span class=verse id=s10v30 title="Surah 10, Verse 30">It is then that every soul will know what it has done, and they will be returned to God their true patron, and they have been abandoned by that which they had invented.</span>
<span class=verse id=s10v31 title="Surah 10, Verse 31">Say: "Who provides for you from the heavens and the earth? Who possesses the hearing and the eyesight? And who brings the living out from the dead and brings the dead out from the living? And who manages all affairs?" They will say: "God." Say: "Will you not be righteous!"</span>
<span class=verse id=s10v32 title="Surah 10, Verse 32">Such is God, your true Lord. So what is after the truth except straying! Why then do you turn away?</span>
<span class=verse id=s10v33 title="Surah 10, Verse 33">It was thus that the command of your Lord came against those who were wicked, for they did not believe.</span>
<span class=verse id=s10v34 title="Surah 10, Verse 34">Say: "Are there any from those whom you have set up as partners who can initiate the creation and then return it?" Say: "God initiates the creation and then returns it." How are you deluded!</span>
<span class=verse id=s10v35 title="Surah 10, Verse 35">Say: "Are there any of those whom you set up as partners who can guide to the truth?" Say: "God guides to the truth. Is He who guides to the truth more worthy of being followed, or he who does not guide except after he is guided? What is wrong with you, how do you judge?"</span>
<span class=verse id=s10v36 title="Surah 10, Verse 36">Most of them only follow conjecture. While conjecture does not avail against the truth in anything. God is aware of what they do.</span>
<span class=verse id=s10v37 title="Surah 10, Verse 37">This Qur'an could not have been produced without God; it is to affirm what is between his hands, and to give details of the Book in which there is no doubt, from the Lord of the worlds.</span>
<span class=verse id=s10v38 title="Surah 10, Verse 38">Or do they say: "He has invented it!" Say: "Then bring a Chapter like it, and call on whom you can besides God if you are truthful."</span>
<span class=verse id=s10v39 title="Surah 10, Verse 39">No, they have lied about that which they had no knowledge, nor has its explanation come to them. It is also how those before them denied, so see how was the retribution of the wicked!</span>
<span class=verse id=s10v40 title="Surah 10, Verse 40">And there are some of them who believe in it, and some of them do not believe in it. Your Lord is better aware of the transgressors.</span>
<span class=verse id=s10v41 title="Surah 10, Verse 41">And if they deny you, then say: "I have my deeds, and you have your deeds. You are innocent from what I do, and I am innocent from what you do."</span>
<span class=verse id=s10v42 title="Surah 10, Verse 42">And there are some of them who listen to you; but can you make the deaf hear, if they do not comprehend?</span>
<span class=verse id=s10v43 title="Surah 10, Verse 43">And there are some of them who look at you; but can you guide the blind, if they do not see?</span>
<span class=verse id=s10v44 title="Surah 10, Verse 44">God does not wrong the people in the least, but it is the people who wrong themselves.</span>
<span class=verse id=s10v45 title="Surah 10, Verse 45">And the Day He gathers them, it will be as if they had stayed but an hour of a day. They will get to know one another. Losers will be those who have denied meeting God, and they have not been guided.</span>
<span class=verse id=s10v46 title="Surah 10, Verse 46">And if We show you some of what We promise them, or We terminate your life, to Us is their return. Then God is a witness over what they do.</span>

<span class=verse id=s10v52 title="Surah 10, Verse 52">Then it will be said to those who were wicked: "Taste the everlasting retribution. You are only recompensed for what you have earned!"</span>
<span class=verse id=s10v53 title="Surah 10, Verse 53">And they seek news from you: "Is it true?" Say: "Yes, by my Lord it is true, and you cannot escape from it."</span>
<span class=verse id=s10v54 title="Surah 10, Verse 54">And if every soul who wronged had possessed all that is on the earth, it would have attempted to ransom it.

<span class=verse id=s11v3 title="Surah 11, Verse 3">"And seek forgiveness from your Lord, then repent to Him; He will provide you with good provisions to an appointed term. And He bestows His grace upon those who are of grace." And if they turn away: "Indeed, I fear for you the retribution of a great day!"</span>
<span class=verse id=s11v4 title="Surah 11, Verse 4">"To God is your return, and He is capable of all things."</span>
<span class=verse id=s11v5 title="Surah 11, Verse 5">Alas, they have folded their chests to hide from it. Even when they cover themselves under their garments, He knows what they keep secret and what they declare. He is Knower of all that is in the chests.</span>
<span class=verse id=s11v6 title="Surah 11, Verse 6">And there is not a creature on the earth but on God is its provision. And He knows where it dwells and where it hides. All is in a clear record.</span>
<span class=verse id=s11v7 title="Surah 11, Verse 7">He is the One who has created the heavens and the earth in six days, and His Throne was upon the water; so as to test who from among you works the best.

<span class=verse id=s11v8 title="Surah 11, Verse 8">And if We delay for them the retribution to a near period, they will say: "What has kept it?" Alas, on the day it comes to them, nothing will turn it away from them, and they will be surrounded by that which they used to mock.</span>
<span class=verse id=s11v9 title="Surah 11, Verse 9">And if We give the human being a taste of a mercy from Us, then We withdraw it from him; he becomes despairing, rejecting.</span>

<span class=verse id=s11v12 title="Surah 11, Verse 12">So perhaps you wish to ignore some of what has been inspired to you, and you are depressed by it, because they say: "If only a treasure was sent down with him, or an angel had come with him!"

<span class=verse id=s11v18 title="Surah 11, Verse 18">And who is more wicked than he who invents lies about God? They will be displayed before their Lord, and the witnesses will say: "These are the ones who have lied about their Lord." Alas, the curse of God will be upon the wicked.</span>
<span class=verse id=s11v19 title="Surah 11, Verse 19">Those who repel others from the path of God and they seek to twist it; and regarding the Hereafter they are in denial.</span>
<span class=verse id=s11v20 title="Surah 11, Verse 20">These are the ones who will not escape on the earth, nor do they have besides God any allies. The retribution will be doubled for them. They were not able to hear, nor could they see.</span>

<span class=verse id=s11v22 title="Surah 11, Verse 22">There is no doubt, that in the Hereafter they are the greatest losers.</span>
<span class=verse id=s11v23 title="Surah 11, Verse 23">Those who believe and do good works, and are humble towards their Lord; they are the dwellers of Paradise, in it they will remain.</span>

<span class=verse id=s11v27 title="Surah 11, Verse 27">The leaders who rejected from among his people said: "We do not see you except as a mortal like us, and we see that only the lowest among our people who have no opinion have followed you. And we do not see a thing that makes you better than us; in fact, we think you are liars."</span>
<span class=verse id=s11v28 title="Surah 11, Verse 28">He said: "O my people, do you see that should I be upon a clarity from my Lord, and He has given me a mercy from Himself, that you may be blinded to it? Shall we compel you to it while in fact you hate it?"</span>
<span class=verse id=s11v29 title="Surah 11, Verse 29">"And my people, I do not ask you for money, my wage is from God. Nor will I turn away those who believe, for they will meet their Lord. But I see that you are a people who are ignorant."</span>
<span class=verse id=s11v30 title="Surah 11, Verse 30">"And my people, who will give me victory against God if I turn them away? Will you not remember!"</span>
<span class=verse id=s11v31 title="Surah 11, Verse 31">"Nor do I say to you that I have the treasures of God, nor do I know the future, nor do I say that I am an angel, nor do I say to those whom your eyes look down upon that God will not grant them any good. God is more aware of what is in their souls; in such case I would be among the wicked."</span>
<span class=verse id=s11v32 title="Surah 11, Verse 32">They said: "O Noah, you have argued with us, and continued arguing with us, so bring us what you promise us if you are of the truthful ones."</span>
<span class=verse id=s11v33 title="Surah 11, Verse 33">He said: "It is God who will bring it to you if He wishes; you will not have any escape."</span>
<span class=verse id=s11v34 title="Surah 11, Verse 34">"And my advice will not benefit you if I wanted to advise you and God wanted that you should go astray. He is your Lord, and to Him you will return."</span>
<span class=verse id=s11v35 title="Surah 11, Verse 35">Or do they say: "He has invented it?" Say: "If I have invented it, then I am responsible for my crime, and I am innocent from your crimes"</span>
<span class=verse id=s11v36 title="Surah 11, Verse 36">And it was inspired to Noah: "No more of your people will believe except those who have already believed. So do not be saddened by what they have done."</span>
<span class=verse id=s11v37 title="Surah 11, Verse 37">"And construct the ship under Our eyes and Our inspiration, and do not speak to Me regarding those who are wicked. They will be drowned."</span>
<span class=verse id=s11v38 title="Surah 11, Verse 38">And as he was constructing the ship, every time any cluster from his people passed by, they mocked him. He said: "If you mock us, then we also mock you as you mock."</span>
<span class=verse id=s11v39 title="Surah 11, Verse 39">"You will know to whom the retribution will come to disgrace him, and upon him will be a lasting punishment."</span>
<span class=verse id=s11v40 title="Surah 11, Verse 40">So, when Our command came and the chamber erupted. We said: "Carry in it a pair from each kind, and your family; except those against whom the word has been issued; and whoever has believed." But those who believed with him were few.</span>
<span class=verse id=s11v41 title="Surah 11, Verse 41">And he said: "Ride in it, in the name of God shall be its running and its anchorage. My Lord is Forgiving, Merciful."</span>
<span class=verse id=s11v42 title="Surah 11, Verse 42">And while it was running with them in waves like mountains, Noah called to his son, who was in an isolated place: "My son, ride with us, and do not be with the rejecters!"</span>
<span class=verse id=s11v43 title="Surah 11, Verse 43">He said: "I will take refuge to the mountain which will protect me from the water." He said: "There is no protection from the decree of God except for those He has granted mercy." And the wave came between them, so he was one of those who drowned.</span>
<span class=verse id=s11v44 title="Surah 11, Verse 44">And it was said: "O land, swallow your water, and O sky, cease." And the water was diminished, and the matter concluded. And it came to rest on the Judi, and it was said: "Away with the wicked people."</span>
<span class=verse id=s11v45 title="Surah 11, Verse 45">And Noah called on his Lord, and he said: "My Lord, my son is from my family, and your promise is the truth, and you are the Wisest of all Judges."</span>
<span class=verse id=s11v46 title="Surah 11, Verse 46">He said: "O Noah, he is not from your family, he was of an unrighteous deed, so do not ask what you have no knowledge of. I advise you not to be of the ignorant."</span>
<span class=verse id=s11v47 title="Surah 11, Verse 47">He said: "My Lord, I seek refuge with You from asking You what I do not have knowledge of. And if You do not forgive me and have mercy on me, I will be of the losers!"</span>
<span class=verse id=s11v48 title="Surah 11, Verse 48">It was said: "O Noah, descend in peace from Us and blessings upon you and upon nations to come from those with you. And nations whom We will give enjoyment, then a painful retribution will reach them from Us."</span>
<span class=verse id=s11v49 title="Surah 11, Verse 49">This is from the news of the unseen that We inspire to you. Neither did you nor your people know this, so be patient; the ending will be for the righteous.</span>
<span class=verse id=s11v50 title="Surah 11, Verse 50">And to 'Aad was sent their brother Hud. He said: "My people, serve God, you have no god besides Him; you are simply conjecturing."</span>
<span class=verse id=s11v51 title="Surah 11, Verse 51">"My people, I do not ask you for any wage, my wage is from the One who has initiated me. Will you not comprehend?"</span>

<span class=verse id=s11v59 title="Surah 11, Verse 59">Such was the case of 'Aad. They disregarded the revelations of their Lord, and they disobeyed His messengers, and they followed the command of every stubborn tyrant.</span>

<span class=verse id=s12v4 title="Surah 12, Verse 4">When Joseph said to his father: "My father, I have seen eleven planets and the sun and the moon, I saw them prostrating to me."</span>
<span class=verse id=s12v5 title="Surah 12, Verse 5">He said: "O my son, do not tell your vision to your brothers, or they will plan against you. The devil is to the human being a clear enemy."</span>
<span class=verse id=s12v6 title="Surah 12, Verse 6">And as such, your Lord has chosen you, and He teaches you the interpretation of the narrations, and He completes His blessings upon you and upon the descendants of Jacob, as He completed it for your fathers before that, Abraham and Isaac. Your Lord is Knowledgeable, Wise.</span>
<span class=verse id=s12v7 title="Surah 12, Verse 7">In Joseph and his brothers are signs for those who seek.</span>
<span class=verse id=s12v8 title="Surah 12, Verse 8">For they said: "Joseph and his brother are more loved by our father than us, while we are a numerous group. Our father is clearly misguided."</span>
<span class=verse id=s12v9 title="Surah 12, Verse 9">"Kill Joseph or cast him in the land, so that the face of your father will be only for you, and after that you can be an upright people."</span>

<span class=verse id=s12v11 title="Surah 12, Verse 11">They said: "Our father, why do you not trust us with Joseph? And we will be giving him advice."</span>
<span class=verse id=s12v12 title="Surah 12, Verse 12">"Send him with us tomorrow to enjoy himself and play, and we will take care of him."</span>
<span class=verse id=s12v13 title="Surah 12, Verse 13">He said: "It saddens me that you should take him, and I fear that the wolf will eat him if you will be absent of him."</span>

<span class=verse id=s12v15 title="Surah 12, Verse 15">So, when they went with him they had agreed to place him into the bottom of the well. And We inspired to him: "You will inform them of this act of theirs while they will not expect it."</span>
<span class=verse id=s12v16 title="Surah 12, Verse 16">And they came to their father in the evening, crying.</span>

<span class=verse id=s12v19 title="Surah 12, Verse 19">And a traveling caravan came and they sent their man to draw water, but when he drew he said: "Good news, there is a boy!" So they hid him as merchandise. And God is aware of what they did.</span>
<span class=verse id=s12v20 title="Surah 12, Verse 20">And they sold him for a low price, a few coins of silver, and they regarded him as insignificant.</span>
<span class=verse id=s12v21 title="Surah 12, Verse 21">And he from Egypt who had bought him said to his wife: "Make his stay generous, perhaps he will benefit us or we may take him as a son." And it was thus that We established Joseph in the land and to teach him the interpretation of the narrations. And God has full control over his situation, but most of the people do not know.</span>
<span class=verse id=s12v22 title="Surah 12, Verse 22">And when he reached his independence, We gave him judgement and knowledge. It is thus that We reward the good doers.</span>
<span class=verse id=s12v23 title="Surah 12, Verse 23">And the woman, in whose house he was staying, attempted to seduce him away from himself. And she closed the doors and said: "I have prepared myself for you." He said: "I seek refuge with God, He is my Lord, He has made good my stay; the wicked do not succeed."</span>
<span class=verse id=s12v24 title="Surah 12, Verse 24">And she was obsessed with him, and he did obsess with her-had it not been that he saw the proof of his Lord-it was thus that We turned evil and immorality away from him; he is of Our loyal servants.</span>
<span class=verse id=s12v25 title="Surah 12, Verse 25">And as they rushed towards the door, she tore his shirt from behind; and they found her master at the door. She said: "What is the punishment for he who wanted evil for your family? Is it not that he be imprisoned or punished painfully?"</span>
<span class=verse id=s12v26 title="Surah 12, Verse 26">He said: "She is the one who seduced me from myself," and a witness from her family gave testimony: "If his shirt was torn from the front, then she is truthful, and he is the liar."</span>
<span class=verse id=s12v27 title="Surah 12, Verse 27">"And if his shirt is torn from behind, then she is lying, and he is truthful."</span>
<span class=verse id=s12v28 title="Surah 12, Verse 28">So when he saw that his shirt was torn from behind, he said: "This is from your female planning, your female planning is indeed great!"</span>
<span class=verse id=s12v29 title="Surah 12, Verse 29">"Joseph, turn away from this. And you woman, seek forgiveness for your sin; you were of the wrongdoers."</span>
<span class=verse id=s12v30 title="Surah 12, Verse 30">And some women in the city said: "The wife of the governor is trying to seduce her young man from himself; she is taken by love. We see her clearly misguided."</span>
<span class=verse id=s12v31 title="Surah 12, Verse 31">So when she heard of their scheming, she sent for them and prepared a banquet for them, and she gave each one of them a knife. And she said: "Come out to them," so when they saw him they exalted him and cut their hands, and they said: "Praise be to God, this is not a mortal, but a blessed angel!"</span>
<span class=verse id=s12v32 title="Surah 12, Verse 32">She said: "This is the one whom you blamed me for, and I have  seduced him from himself but he refused. And if he does not do as I command him, he will be imprisoned, and he will be one of those disgraced."</span>
<span class=verse id=s12v33 title="Surah 12, Verse 33">He said: "My Lord, prison is better to me than what they are inviting me to do. And if You do not turn their plans away from me, I will fall for them and be of the ignorant."</span>
<span class=verse id=s12v34 title="Surah 12, Verse 34">So his Lord responded to him, and He turned away their plans from him. He is the Hearer, the Knowledgeable.</span>
<span class=verse id=s12v35 title="Surah 12, Verse 35">But it appealed to them, even after they had seen the signs, to imprison him for a time.</span>
<span class=verse id=s12v36 title="Surah 12, Verse 36">And with him in the prison entered two young men. One of them said: "I dreamt that I was pressing wine," and the other said: "I dreamt that I was carrying bread on top of my head, and that the birds were eating from it." "Tell us its interpretation, for we see that you are of the good doers."</span>
<span class=verse id=s12v37 title="Surah 12, Verse 37">He said: "No provision of food will come to you, except that I would have informed you both about its interpretation before it comes to you. That is from what my Lord has taught me. I have just left the creed of a people who do not believe in God, and they are rejecting the Hereafter."</span>
<span class=verse id=s12v38 title="Surah 12, Verse 38">"And I have followed the creed of my fathers Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob. It was not for us to set up partners with God at all. That is the blessings of God over us and over the people, but most of the people are not thankful."</span>
<span class=verse id=s12v39 title="Surah 12, Verse 39">"O my fellow inmates, are various lords better, or God, the One, the Supreme?"</span>
<span class=verse id=s12v40 title="Surah 12, Verse 40">"What you serve besides Him are nothing except names which you have created, both you and your fathers, God has not sent down any authority for such. The judgment is for none except God. He has ordered that none be served except He. That is the true system, but most of the people do not know."</span>
<span class=verse id=s12v41 title="Surah 12, Verse 41">"My fellow inmates, one of you will be serving wine for his lord, while the other will be crucified so that the birds will eat from his head. The matter which you have sought is now concluded."</span>
<span class=verse id=s12v42 title="Surah 12, Verse 42">And he said to the one of them whom he thought would be saved: "Mention me to your lord." But the devil made him forget to mention to his lord, so he remained in prison for a few years.</span>
<span class=verse id=s12v43 title="Surah 12, Verse 43">And the king said: "I continue to dream of seven fat cows being eaten by seven thin ones, and seven green pods and others which are dry. O you commanders, tell me what my vision means if you are able to interpret the visions."</span>
<span class=verse id=s12v44 title="Surah 12, Verse 44">They said: "It is nothing except bad dreams; and we are not knowledgeable in the interpretation of dreams."</span>
<span class=verse id=s12v45 title="Surah 12, Verse 45">And the one of them who had been saved and remembered after all this time said: "I will tell you of its interpretation, so let me be sent."</span>
<span class=verse id=s12v46 title="Surah 12, Verse 46">"Joseph, O man of truth, explain to us the matter regarding seven fat cows being eaten by seven thin ones, and seven green pods and others which are dry? Then perhaps I may go back to the people so they will know."</span>
<span class=verse id=s12v47 title="Surah 12, Verse 47">He said: "You will plant regularly for seven years, and whatever you harvest you must leave it in its pods, except for the little that you will eat."</span>
<span class=verse id=s12v48 title="Surah 12, Verse 48">"Then there will come seven after that which are severe and which will consume all that you plant except for what you have stored."</span>
<span class=verse id=s12v49 title="Surah 12, Verse 49">"Then after that will come a calendar year in which the people will have abundant rain and which they will be able to produce once again."</span>
<span class=verse id=s12v50 title="Surah 12, Verse 50">And the king said: "Bring him to me." So when the messenger came to him, he said: "Go back to your lord and ask him what was the matter regarding the women who cut their hands? Indeed, my Lord is aware of their plans."</span>
<span class=verse id=s12v51 title="Surah 12, Verse 51">He said: "What is your plea that you tried to seduce Joseph from himself?" They said: "God be sought! We know of no evil on his part." The wife of the governor said: "Now the truth must be known, I did seek to seduce Joseph from himself and he is of the truthful ones."</span>
<span class=verse id=s12v52 title="Surah 12, Verse 52">"That is so he knows that I will not betray him while he is not present and that God does not guide the planning of the betrayers."</span>
<span class=verse id=s12v53 title="Surah 12, Verse 53">"And I do not make myself free of blame, for the soul is inclined to sin, except that which my Lord has mercy upon. My Lord is Forgiving, Merciful."</span>
<span class=verse id=s12v54 title="Surah 12, Verse 54">And the king said: "Bring him to me so that I may employ him to my person." So when he spoke to him, he said: "Today you are with us in a high standing and trusted."</span>
<span class=verse id=s12v55 title="Surah 12, Verse 55">He said: "Appoint me over the granaries of the land, for I know how to keep records and I am knowledgeable."</span>
<span class=verse id=s12v56 title="Surah 12, Verse 56">And it was such that We gave Joseph authority in the land, to travel in it as he pleases. We bestow Our mercy upon whom We please, and We do not waste the reward of the good doers.</span>
<span class=verse id=s12v57 title="Surah 12, Verse 57">And the reward of the Hereafter is better for those who believe and are aware.</span>
<span class=verse id=s12v58 title="Surah 12, Verse 58">And the brothers of Joseph came and entered upon him, and he recognized them, but they did not recognize him.</span>
<span class=verse id=s12v59 title="Surah 12, Verse 59">So, when he furnished them with their provisions, he said: "Bring me a brother of yours who is from your father. Do you not see that I give full measure of grain and that I am the best of hosts?"</span>
<span class=verse id=s12v60 title="Surah 12, Verse 60">"But if you do not bring him to me, then there shall be no measure of grain for you with me, and do not come near me."</span>
<span class=verse id=s12v61 title="Surah 12, Verse 61">They said: "We will try to get him away from his father, and we shall be successful."</span>
<span class=verse id=s12v62 title="Surah 12, Verse 62">And he said to his servants: "Return their goods into their saddlebags, so that they may recognize it when they return to their family so that they may come back."</span>
<span class=verse id=s12v63 title="Surah 12, Verse 63">So when they returned to their father, they said: "Our father, we have been banned from getting anymore measure of grain, so send our brother with us so we may be given a measure of grain, and we will be his guardians."</span>
<span class=verse id=s12v64 title="Surah 12, Verse 64">He said: "Shall I trust him with you as I trusted you with Joseph before that? God is the best guardian, and He is the Most Merciful of those who show mercy."</span>
<span class=verse id=s12v65 title="Surah 12, Verse 65">So when they opened their baggage, they found their goods had been returned to them, and they said: "Our father, what more can we desire, these are our goods returned to us, so we can get more for our family, and be guardians over our brother, and increase a measure of grain to load a camel. That is truly an easy measure!"</span>
<span class=verse id=s12v66 title="Surah 12, Verse 66">He said: "I will not send him with you until you come to me with a covenant to God that you will bring him back unless you are completely overtaken." So when they brought him their covenant, he said: "God is placed in trust over what we say."</span>
<span class=verse id=s12v67 title="Surah 12, Verse 67">And he said: "My sons, do not enter from one gate, but enter from separate gates; and I cannot avail you anything against God, for the judgment is to God. In Him I place my trust, and in Him those who place their trust should trust."</span>
<span class=verse id=s12v68 title="Surah 12, Verse 68">And when they entered from where their father had commanded them, it would not have availed them in the least against God, but it was out of a concern in the soul of Jacob that he brought out. And he is with knowledge for what We taught him, but most of the people do not know.</span>
<span class=verse id=s12v69 title="Surah 12, Verse 69">And when they entered upon Joseph, he called his brother to himself and said: "I am your brother, so do not be saddened by what they have done."</span>
<span class=verse id=s12v70 title="Surah 12, Verse 70">So when he furnished them with their provisions, he placed the measuring bowl in the saddlebag of his brother, then a caller cried out: "O you in the caravan, you are thieves!"</span>
<span class=verse id=s12v71 title="Surah 12, Verse 71">They said, while coming towards them: "What is it you are missing?"</span>
<span class=verse id=s12v72 title="Surah 12, Verse 72">They said: "We are missing the measuring bowl of the king, and whoever can produce it, will be given the load of a camel; and I will be bound by this."</span>
<span class=verse id=s12v73 title="Surah 12, Verse 73">They said: "By God, you know we have not come to cause corruption in the land, and we are not thieves!"</span>
<span class=verse id=s12v74 title="Surah 12, Verse 74">They said: "What shall be the punishment, if you are not truthful?"</span>
<span class=verse id=s12v75 title="Surah 12, Verse 75">They said: "The punishment is that he in whose saddlebag it is found will himself serve as the punishment. It is so that we punish the wicked."</span>
<span class=verse id=s12v76 title="Surah 12, Verse 76">So he began with their bags before the bag of his brother. Then he brought it out of the bag of his brother. It was such that We planned for Joseph, for he would not have been able to take his brother under the system of the king, except that God wished it so. We raise the degrees of whom We please, and over every one of knowledge is the All Knowledgeable.</span>
<span class=verse id=s12v77 title="Surah 12, Verse 77">They said: "If he has stolen, there was a brother of his before who also had stolen." Joseph kept this all inside himself, and did not reveal anything to them. He said: "You are in an awkward position, and God best knows what you describe."</span>
<span class=verse id=s12v78 title="Surah 12, Verse 78">They said: "O governor, he has an elderly father, so take one of us in his place. Indeed we see you as one of the good doers."</span>
<span class=verse id=s12v79 title="Surah 12, Verse 79">He said: "Refuge is sought with God that we would take anyone except he whom we found our belongings with. Indeed, we would then be wrong doers."</span>
<span class=verse id=s12v80 title="Surah 12, Verse 80">So when they gave up from him, they held a conference in private. The eldest of them said: "Did you not know that your father has taken a covenant over you with God, and before this you also failed in your duty with Joseph? I will not leave this land until my father permits me to do so or that God will judge for me. He is the best of judges."</span>
<span class=verse id=s12v81 title="Surah 12, Verse 81">"Return to your father, and tell him: "Our father, your son has stolen, and we did not witness except what we learned, and we could not know the unseen!"</span>

<span class=verse id=s12v90 title="Surah 12, Verse 90">They said: "Are you indeed Joseph?" He said: "I am Joseph, and this is my brother. God has been gracious to us. For anyone who reverences and is patient, God will not waste the reward of the good doers."</span>

<span class=verse id=s13v1 title="Surah 13, Verse 1">ALMR, these are the signs of the Book. And what has been sent down to you from your Lord is the truth; but most of the people do not believe.</span>
<span class=verse id=s13v2 title="Surah 13, Verse 2">God, Who raised the heavens without any pillars that you can see, then He settled upon the Throne, and He commissioned the sun and the moon, each running for an appointed term. He manages all affairs, and He details the signs so that you will be aware of the meeting with your Lord.</span>
<span class=verse id=s13v3 title="Surah 13, Verse 3">And He is the One who has spread out the land, and made in it stabilizers and rivers, and all the fruits He made in pairs. The night covers the day. In that are signs for a people who think.</span>
<span class=verse id=s13v4 title="Surah 13, Verse 4">And on the earth are neighboring pieces of land with gardens of grapes and plants and palm trees, some of which may be twin sharing the same root, or single, even though they are being watered with the same water source; and We make preference for some of them over others in what they consume. In that are signs for a people who comprehend.</span>
<span class=verse id=s13v5 title="Surah 13, Verse 5">And if you are surprised, then what is more surprising is their saying: "Can it be that when we are dust, we will be created anew!" These are the ones who have rejected their Lord, and they will have shackles around their necks, and they are the dwellers of the Fire, in it they will abide.</span>
<span class=verse id=s13v6 title="Surah 13, Verse 6">And they hasten towards you with evil before good, and the examples of those before them have already been given. And your Lord is with forgiveness towards the people for their transgression, and your Lord is severe in retribution.</span>
<span class=verse id=s13v7 title="Surah 13, Verse 7">And those who reject say: "If only a sign was sent down to him from his Lord." You are but a warner, and to every people is a guide.</span>
<span class=verse id=s13v8 title="Surah 13, Verse 8">God knows what every female carries, and how short her pregnancy is or how long. And everything with Him is measured.</span>
<span class=verse id=s13v9 title="Surah 13, Verse 9">The Knower of the unseen and the seen, the Great, the Most High.</span>
<span class=verse id=s13v10 title="Surah 13, Verse 10">It is the same whether any of you openly declares what he says, or conceals it; whether he is hiding in the night or going openly in the day.</span>
<span class=verse id=s13v11 title="Surah 13, Verse 11">Present with him and behind him are retainers, they preserve him from the command of God. God does not change the condition of a people until they change the condition of their souls. And if God wanted to harm a people, then there is no turning Him back, nor will they have any protector against Him.</span>
<span class=verse id=s13v12 title="Surah 13, Verse 12">He is the One who shows you the lightning, giving you fear and hope. And He establishes the heavy clouds.</span>
<span class=verse id=s13v13 title="Surah 13, Verse 13">And the thunder glorifies His praise, and the angels are in awe of Him, and He sends the thunderbolts to strike with them whom He wills. Yet they are still arguing regarding God, while He is severe in punishment.</span>
<span class=verse id=s13v14 title="Surah 13, Verse 14">To Him is the call of truth. And those who are called on besides Him, they will not respond to them in anything; like one who places his hands openly in the water to drink, except it never reaches his mouth. The call of the rejecters is nothing but in misguidance.</span>
<span class=verse id=s13v15 title="Surah 13, Verse 15">And to God will prostrate all who are in the heavens and the earth, willingly and unwillingly, as do their shadows in the morning and the evening.</span>
<span class=verse id=s13v16 title="Surah 13, Verse 16">Say: "Who is the Lord of the heavens and the earth?" Say: "God." Say: "Have you taken besides Him allies who do not possess for themselves any benefit or harm?" Say: "Is the blind and the seer the same? Or do the darkness and the light equate? Or have they set up partners with God who have created like His creation, so the creations all seemed the same to them?" Say: "God has created all things, and He is the One, the Supreme."</span>
<span class=verse id=s13v17 title="Surah 13, Verse 17">He sends down water from the sky, so valleys flow according to their capacity, and the flood produces foam. And from what they burn to smelt jewelry or goods is produced a similar foam. It is in such a manner that God strikes the falsehood with the truth. As for the foam, it passes away, and as for what benefits the people, it remains in the earth. It is such that God puts forth the examples.</span>
<span class=verse id=s13v18 title="Surah 13, Verse 18">For those who have responded to their Lord is goodness. As for those who have not responded to Him, if they had all that is on the earth twice over, they would ransom it to be saved. For these will be a terrible reckoning, and their abode is Hell; what a miserable abode.</span>
<span class=verse id=s13v19 title="Surah 13, Verse 19">Is he who knows that the truth has been sent down to you from your Lord like he who is blind? Only those who possess intelligence will remember.</span>
<span class=verse id=s13v20 title="Surah 13, Verse 20">Those who fulfill the pledge of God, and they do not break the covenant.</span>
<span class=verse id=s13v21 title="Surah 13, Verse 21">And those who deliver what God has ordered to be delivered, and they are concerned towards their Lord and they fear a terrible reckoning.</span>
<span class=verse id=s13v22 title="Surah 13, Verse 22">And those who are patient seeking the face of their Lord; and they hold the contact prayer, and they spend from what We have bestowed upon them secretly and openly, and they counter evil with good; these will have an excellent abode.</span>
<span class=verse id=s13v23 title="Surah 13, Verse 23">The gardens of delight; which they will enter with those who are good doers from their fathers and their mates and their progeny. And the angels will enter upon them from every gate.</span>
<span class=verse id=s13v24 title="Surah 13, Verse 24">"Peace be upon you for what you have been patient for. Excellent indeed is the final abode."</span>
<span class=verse id=s13v25 title="Surah 13, Verse 25">As for those who break their pledge with God after having made its covenant, and they withhold what God has ordered to be delivered, and they cause corruption on the earth; upon those is a curse and they will have a miserable abode.</span>
<span class=verse id=s13v26 title="Surah 13, Verse 26">God gives the provisions for whom He wishes, and He is Capable. And they were happy with the worldly life, but the worldly life compared to the Hereafter is nothing except a brief enjoyment.</span>
<span class=verse id=s13v27 title="Surah 13, Verse 27">And those who have rejected say: "If only a sign were sent down to him from his Lord!" Say: "God misguides whom He wishes and guides to Him whoever is repenting."</span>
<span class=verse id=s13v28 title="Surah 13, Verse 28">The ones who have believed, and their hearts are relieved by the remembrance of God; for in the remembrance of God the hearts are relieved.</span>
<span class=verse id=s13v29 title="Surah 13, Verse 29">The ones who have believed, and have done good works, there will be happiness for them and a wonderful abode.</span>
<span class=verse id=s13v30 title="Surah 13, Verse 30">Thus, We have sent you to a nation, as with other nations before it, so that you may recite to them that which has been inspired to you; while they are still rejecting the Almighty. Say: "He is my Lord, there is no god except He, in Him I place my trust and to Him is my repentance."</span>
<span class=verse id=s13v31 title="Surah 13, Verse 31">And if a revelation were to be used to move mountains, or to slice the earth, or the dead were spoken to with it! Indeed, to God are all matters. Did not those who have believed know that if God had wished He would have guided all the people? As for those who reject, they continue to be stricken with disaster or it comes near to their homes, until the promise of God comes true. God does not break the appointment.</span>
<span class=verse id=s13v32 title="Surah 13, Verse 32">And messengers before you were mocked, but I gave time to those who had rejected, then I took them; so how was My punishment?</span>
<span class=verse id=s13v33 title="Surah 13, Verse 33">It is He who is standing upon every soul for what it has earned; yet they set up partners with God. Say: "Name them?" Or are you informing Him of what He does not know on the earth or is it just a show of words? Indeed, to the rejecters, their scheming is made to appear pleasing, and they are repelled from the path. And whoever God misguides will have no guide.</span>
<span class=verse id=s13v34 title="Surah 13, Verse 34">They will have a punishment in the worldly life, and the punishment of the Hereafter is more difficult. And they will have no defender against God.</span>
<span class=verse id=s13v35 title="Surah 13, Verse 35">The example of Paradise which the righteous are promised, is that rivers flow beneath it, and its provisions are continuous as is its shade. Such is the abode of those who were righteous, while the abode of the rejecters is the Fire.</span>
<span class=verse id=s13v36 title="Surah 13, Verse 36">And those to whom We have previously given the Book rejoice at what has been sent down to you, but there are some from the Confederates who reject parts of it. Say: "I am only ordered to serve God and not set up any partner with Him. Towards Him I implore and towards Him is the return."</span>
<span class=verse id=s13v37 title="Surah 13, Verse 37">And as such, We have sent it down a law which is in Arabic. And if you follow their desires after what has come to you of the knowledge, then you will not have any ally or defender against God.</span>
<span class=verse id=s13v38 title="Surah 13, Verse 38">And We have sent messengers before you and We have made for them mates and offspring. It was not for a messenger to come with any sign except with the permission of God; for each period there is a Book.</span>
<span class=verse id=s13v39 title="Surah 13, Verse 39">God erases and confirms what He wishes, and with Him is the source of the Book.</span>
<span class=verse id=s13v40 title="Surah 13, Verse 40">And if We show you some of what We promise them, or We terminate your life, then you are only to deliver while for Us is the reckoning.</span>
<span class=verse id=s13v41 title="Surah 13, Verse 41">Do they not see that We come to the land and reduce it from its ends? And God gives judgment and there is none to override His judgment. And He is swift to reckoning.</span>
<span class=verse id=s13v42 title="Surah 13, Verse 42">And those before them had schemed, but to God is all scheming. He knows what every soul earns and the rejecters will come to know to whom is the better abode.</span>
<span class=verse id=s13v43 title="Surah 13, Verse 43">And those who reject say: "You are not a messenger." Say: "God is enough as a witness between me and you; the One who has the knowledge of the Book."</span>

<span class=verse id=s14v5 title="Surah 14, Verse 5">And We sent Moses with Our signs: "You shall bring your people out of the darkness and into the light, and remind them of the days of God." In this are signs for everyone patient and thankful.</span>
<span class=verse id=s14v6 title="Surah 14, Verse 6">And Moses said to his people: "Remember the blessings of God upon you that He saved you from the people of Pharaoh; they were afflicting you with the worst punishment, and they used to slaughter your children, and rape your women.

<span class=verse id=s14v7 title="Surah 14, Verse 7">And your Lord proclaimed: "If you give thanks, I will increase for you, but if you are rejecting, then My retribution is severe."</span>

<span class=verse id=s18v5 title="Surah 18, Verse 5">They have no knowledge of this, nor do their fathers. Tremendous indeed is the word coming out of their mouths. They are but saying a lie!</span>

<span class=verse id=s18v13 title="Surah 18, Verse 13">We tell to you their news with the truth. They were youths who believed in their Lord, and We increased them in guidance.</span>

Their Lord is fully aware of them, those who managed to win the argument said: "We will construct a temple over them."</span>
<span class=verse id=s18v22 title="Surah 18, Verse 22">They will say: "Three, the fourth is their dog." And they say: "Five, the sixth is their dog," guessing at what they do not know.

<span class=verse id=s18v29 title="Surah 18, Verse 29">And say: "The truth is from your Lord, so let whoever desires believe, and whoever desires reject."

<span class=verse id=s18v32 title="Surah 18, Verse 32">And give them the example of two men: We made for one of them two gardens of grapes, and We surrounded them with palm trees, and We made crops in their midst.</span>
<span class=verse id=s18v33 title="Surah 18, Verse 33">Each of the two gardens brought forth its produce, and none failed in the least. And We caused a river to gush through them.</span>

<span class=verse id=s18v36 title="Surah 18, Verse 36">"And I do not think that the Hour is coming. And if I am indeed returned to my Lord, then I will surely find even better things for me."</span>
<span class=verse id=s18v37 title="Surah 18, Verse 37">His friend said to him while discussing with him: "Have you disbelieved in the One who has created you from dust, then from a seed, then He evolved you into a man?"</span>

<span class=verse id=s18v43 title="Surah 18, Verse 43">And he had no group which could help against God, and he would not have had victory.</span>
<span class=verse id=s18v44 title="Surah 18, Verse 44">Such is the true authority of God. He is best to reward, and best to end.</span>
<span class=verse id=s18v45 title="Surah 18, Verse 45">And give them the example of this worldly life is like a water which We have sent down from the sky, so that the plants of the earth mix with it and it becomes murky being moved by the wind. And God is capable of all things.</span>
<span class=verse id=s18v46 title="Surah 18, Verse 46">Wealth and sons are a beauty of this worldly life. But the good deeds that remain behind are better with your Lord for a reward, and better for hope.</span>

<span class=verse id=s18v50 title="Surah 18, Verse 50">And We said to the angels: "Yield to Adam." So they all yielded except for Satan. He was of the Jinn, he disobeyed the order of his Lord.

<span class=verse id=s18v55 title="Surah 18, Verse 55">And what prevented the people from believing when the guidance came to them, and to seek forgiveness from their Lord? Are they waiting for what happened to the people of old to come to them, or that the retribution be brought to them face to face?</span>
<span class=verse id=s18v56 title="Surah 18, Verse 56">And We do not send the messengers except as bearers of good news and warners. But those who reject will argue using falsehood to overshadow the truth with it. And they took My revelations and what they have been warned by for mockery!</span>
<span class=verse id=s18v57 title="Surah 18, Verse 57">And who is more wicked than he who was reminded of the revelations of his Lord but he turned away from them, and he forgot what his hands had done. We have made veils upon their hearts from understanding it, and a deafness in their ears. And if you invite them to the guidance, they will never be guided.</span>
<span class=verse id=s18v58 title="Surah 18, Verse 58">And your Lord is forgiving, with mercy. If He were to evaluate the people for what they had already earned, He would hasten for them the retribution. No, they have an appointment, beyond which they will find no escape.</span>
<span class=verse id=s18v59 title="Surah 18, Verse 59">And those towns, We destroyed them when they transgressed. And We made for their destruction an appointed time.</span>
<span class=verse id=s18v60 title="Surah 18, Verse 60">And Moses said to his youth: "I will not stop until I reach the junction of the two seas, or I spend a lifetime trying."</span>
<span class=verse id=s18v61 title="Surah 18, Verse 61">But when they reached the junction that was in-between, they forgot their fish, and it was able to make its way back to the sea in a stream.</span>
<span class=verse id=s18v62 title="Surah 18, Verse 62">And when they passed further on, he said to his youth: "Bring us our lunch; we have found much fatigue in this journey of ours."</span>
<span class=verse id=s18v63 title="Surah 18, Verse 63">He said: "Do you remember when we rested upon the rock? I forgot the fish, and it was the devil who made me forget to remember it. It made its way back to the sea amazingly!"</span>
<span class=verse id=s18v64 title="Surah 18, Verse 64">He said: "That is what we have been seeking!" So they went back retracing their steps.</span>
<span class=verse id=s18v65 title="Surah 18, Verse 65">So they came upon a servant of Ours whom We had given him mercy from Us and We had taught him knowledge from Us.</span>
<span class=verse id=s18v66 title="Surah 18, Verse 66">Moses said to him: "Can I follow you so that you will teach me from the guidance you have been taught?"</span>
<span class=verse id=s18v67 title="Surah 18, Verse 67">He said: "You will not be able to have patience with me."</span>
<span class=verse id=s18v68 title="Surah 18, Verse 68">"And how can you be patient about that which you have not been given any news?"</span>
<span class=verse id=s18v69 title="Surah 18, Verse 69">He said: "You will find me, God willing, to be patient. And I will not disobey any command of yours."</span>
<span class=verse id=s18v70 title="Surah 18, Verse 70">He said: "If you follow me, then do not ask about anything until I relate it to you."</span>
<span class=verse id=s18v71 title="Surah 18, Verse 71">So they ventured forth until they rode in a boat and he made a hole in it. He said: "Have you made a hole in it to drown its people? You have done something dreadful!"</span>
<span class=verse id=s18v72 title="Surah 18, Verse 72">He said: "Did I not tell you that you will not be able to have patience with me?"</span>
<span class=verse id=s18v73 title="Surah 18, Verse 73">He said: "Forgive me for what I forgot, and do not be hard upon my request with you."</span>
<span class=verse id=s18v74 title="Surah 18, Verse 74">So they ventured forth until they came upon a youth, and he killed him. He said: "Have you killed an innocent person without justice? You have done something awful!"</span>
<span class=verse id=s18v75 title="Surah 18, Verse 75">He said: "Did I not tell you that you will not be able to have patience with me?"</span>
<span class=verse id=s18v76 title="Surah 18, Verse 76">He said: "If I ask you about anything after this, then do not keep me in your company. You will then have a reason over me."</span>
<span class=verse id=s18v77 title="Surah 18, Verse 77">So they ventured forth until they came to the people of a town. They requested food from its people but they refused to host them. Then they found a wall which was close to collapsing, so he built it. He said: "If you had wished, you could have asked a wage for it!"</span>
<span class=verse id=s18v78 title="Surah 18, Verse 78">He said: "For this, we will now part ways. I will inform you of the meanings of those things that you could not have patience over."</span>
<span class=verse id=s18v79 title="Surah 18, Verse 79">"As for the boat, it belonged to some poor people who were working the sea, so I wanted to damage it as there was a king coming who takes every boat by force."</span>
<span class=verse id=s18v80 title="Surah 18, Verse 80">"And as for the youth, his parents were believers, so we were concerned that he would oppress them by his transgression and disbelief."</span>
<span class=verse id=s18v81 title="Surah 18, Verse 81">"So we wanted their Lord to replace for them with one who is better than him in purity and closer to mercy."</span>
<span class=verse id=s18v82 title="Surah 18, Verse 82">"And as for the wall, it belonged to two orphaned boys in the city, and underneath it was a treasure for them, and their father was a good man, so your Lord wanted that they reach their independence and bring out their treasure as a mercy from your Lord. And none of what I have done was of my own accord. That is the meaning of what you could not have patience for."</span>
<span class=verse id=s18v83 title="Surah 18, Verse 83">And they ask you about the Two Horned One, say: "I will recite to you a remembrance of him."</span>
<span class=verse id=s18v84 title="Surah 18, Verse 84">We had facilitated for him in the land, and We had given him the means to all things.</span>
<span class=verse id=s18v85 title="Surah 18, Verse 85">So he followed the means.</span>
<span class=verse id=s18v86 title="Surah 18, Verse 86">Until he reached the setting of the sun; he found it setting at a hot spring, and he found a people near it. We said: "O Two Horned One, either you shall punish, or you shall do them good."</span>
<span class=verse id=s18v87 title="Surah 18, Verse 87">He said: "As for he who has done wrong, we will punish him then he will be returned to his Lord and He will punish him an awful punishment."</span>
<span class=verse id=s18v88 title="Surah 18, Verse 88">"And as for he who believes and does good, then he will have the reward of goodness, and we will speak to him simply of our plan."</span>
<span class=verse id=s18v89 title="Surah 18, Verse 89">Then he followed the means.</span>
<span class=verse id=s18v90 title="Surah 18, Verse 90">So when he reached the rising of the sun, he found it rising on a people for whom We did not make any cover except it.</span>
<span class=verse id=s18v91 title="Surah 18, Verse 91">So it was, and We knew ahead of time about what he intended.</span>
<span class=verse id=s18v92 title="Surah 18, Verse 92">Then he followed the means.</span>
<span class=verse id=s18v93 title="Surah 18, Verse 93">Until he reached the area between the two barriers, he found no one besides them except a people who could barely understand anything said.</span>
<span class=verse id=s18v94 title="Surah 18, Verse 94">They said: "O Two Horned One, Gog and Magog are destroyers of the land, so shall we make a tribute for you that you will make between us and them a barrier?"</span>
<span class=verse id=s18v95 title="Surah 18, Verse 95">He said: "What my Lord has given me is far better. So help me with strength and I will make between you and them a barrier."</span>
<span class=verse id=s18v96 title="Surah 18, Verse 96">"Bring me iron ore." Until he leveled between the two walls, he said: "Blow," until he made it a furnace, he said: "Bring me tar so I can pour it over."</span>
<span class=verse id=s18v97 title="Surah 18, Verse 97">So they could not come over it, and they could not make a hole in it.</span>
<span class=verse id=s18v98 title="Surah 18, Verse 98">He said: "This is a mercy from my Lord. But when the promise of my Lord comes, He will make it rubble. And the  promise of my Lord is truth."</span>
<span class=verse id=s18v99 title="Surah 18, Verse 99">And We left them until that day to surge like waves on one another. And the horn was blown, so We gathered them together.</span>
<span class=verse id=s18v100 title="Surah 18, Verse 100">And We displayed Hell on that Day to the rejecters openly.</span>
<span class=verse id=s18v101 title="Surah 18, Verse 101">Those whose eyes were covered against My remembrance, and they were unable to hear.</span>
<span class=verse id=s18v102 title="Surah 18, Verse 102">Did those who reject think that they could take My servants as allies besides Me? We have prepared Hell for the rejecters as a dwelling.</span>
<span class=verse id=s18v103 title="Surah 18, Verse 103">Say: "Shall we inform you of the greatest losers?"</span>
<span class=verse id=s18v104 title="Surah 18, Verse 104">"Those whose efforts in the worldly life were wasted while they thought they were doing good!"</span>
<span class=verse id=s18v105 title="Surah 18, Verse 105">These are the ones who rejected the revelations of their Lord and His meeting. So their works were in vain, and We will not give them any value on the Day of Resurrection.</span>
<span class=verse id=s18v106 title="Surah 18, Verse 106">That is their recompense, Hell; for what they rejected and for taking My revelations and My messengers for mockery!</span>
<span class=verse id=s18v107 title="Surah 18, Verse 107">Those who believe and do good works, they will have the gardens of Paradise  as a dwelling.</span>
<span class=verse id=s18v108 title="Surah 18, Verse 108">Abiding therein. They will not want to be moved from it.</span>
<span class=verse id=s18v109 title="Surah 18, Verse 109">Say: "If the sea were an inkwell for the words of my Lord, then the sea would run out before the words of my Lord run out;" even if We were to bring another like it as an extension.</span>
<span class=verse id=s18v110 title="Surah 18, Verse 110">Say: "I am but a mortal like you, being inspired that your god is One god. So whoever looks forward to meeting his Lord, then let him do good works, and not serve anyone besides his Lord."</span>

<span class=verse id=s19v9 title="Surah 19, Verse 9">He said: "It is such that your Lord has said. It is an easy thing for Me. And I had created you before, when you were not a thing."</span>
<span class=verse id=s19v10 title="Surah 19, Verse 10">He said: "My Lord, make for me a sign." He said: "Your sign is that you will not speak to the people for three nights consecutively."</span>
<span class=verse id=s19v11 title="Surah 19, Verse 11">So he went out among his people from the temple enclosure, and he indicated to them that they should glorify Him at dawn and dusk.</span>
<span class=verse id=s19v12 title="Surah 19, Verse 12">"O John, take the Book with confidence." And We gave him authority while in his youth.</span>

<span class=verse id=s19v23 title="Surah 19, Verse 23">Then the birth pains came to her, by the trunk of a palm tree. She said: "I wish I had died before this, and became totally forgotten!"</span>
<span class=verse id=s19v24 title="Surah 19, Verse 24">But then he called to her from beneath her: "Do not be sad, your Lord has made below you a stream."</span>

<span class=verse id=s20v41 title="Surah 20, Verse 41">"And I Have raised you for Myself."</span>

<span class=verse id=s20v44 title="Surah 20, Verse 44">"So say to him soft words, perhaps he will remember or be concerned."</span>
<span class=verse id=s20v45 title="Surah 20, Verse 45">They said: "Our Lord, we fear that he would let loose upon us, or transgress."</span>
<span class=verse id=s20v46 title="Surah 20, Verse 46">He said: "Do not fear, I am with you, I hear and I see."</span>
<span class=verse id=s20v47 title="Surah 20, Verse 47">So come to him and say: "We are messengers from your Lord, so send with us the Children of Israel, and do not punish them. We have come to you with a sign from your Lord, and peace be upon those who follow the guidance."</span>
<span class=verse id=s20v48 title="Surah 20, Verse 48">"It has been inspired to us that the retribution will be upon he who denies and turns away."</span>
<span class=verse id=s20v49 title="Surah 20, Verse 49">He said: "So who is the lord of you both O Moses?"</span>
<span class=verse id=s20v50 title="Surah 20, Verse 50">He said: "Our Lord is the One who gave everything its creation, then guided."</span>
<span class=verse id=s20v51 title="Surah 20, Verse 51">He said: "What then has happened to the previous generations?"</span>
<span class=verse id=s20v52 title="Surah 20, Verse 52">He said: "The knowledge of it is with my Lord, in a record. My Lord does not err or forget."</span>
<span class=verse id=s20v53 title="Surah 20, Verse 53">The One who made for you the earth habitable and He made ways for you in it, and He brought down water from the sky, so We brought out with it pairs of vegetation of all types.</span>

<span class=verse id=s20v55 title="Surah 20, Verse 55">From it We created you and in it We return you, and from it We bring you out another time.</span>
<span class=verse id=s20v56 title="Surah 20, Verse 56">And We showed him Our signs, all of them, but he denied and refused.</span>
<span class=verse id=s20v57 title="Surah 20, Verse 57">He said: "Have you come to us to take us out of our land with your magic O Moses?"</span>
<span class=verse id=s20v58 title="Surah 20, Verse 58">"We will bring you a magic like it, so let us make an appointment between us and you which neither of us will break, a place where we both agree."</span>
<span class=verse id=s20v59 title="Surah 20, Verse 59">He said: "Your appointment is the day of festival, and when the people start crowding during the late morning."</span>
<span class=verse id=s20v60 title="Surah 20, Verse 60">So Pharaoh went away, and he gathered his plan then he came.</span>
<span class=verse id=s20v61 title="Surah 20, Verse 61">Moses said to them: "Woe to you, do not invent lies about God, else the retribution will take you, and miserable is the one who invents."</span>
<span class=verse id=s20v62 title="Surah 20, Verse 62">So they disputed in their matter between themselves, and they kept private their counsel.</span>
<span class=verse id=s20v63 title="Surah 20, Verse 63">They said: "These are but two magicians who want to take you out of your land with their magic, and they want to do away with your ideal way."</span>
<span class=verse id=s20v64 title="Surah 20, Verse 64">"So agree your plan, then come as one front. Whoever wins today will succeed."</span>
<span class=verse id=s20v65 title="Surah 20, Verse 65">They said: "O Moses, either you cast down or we will be the first to cast down."</span>
<span class=verse id=s20v66 title="Surah 20, Verse 66">He said: "You cast down." So their ropes and staffs appeared from their magic as if they were moving.</span>
<span class=verse id=s20v67 title="Surah 20, Verse 67">And Moses held some fear in himself.</span>
<span class=verse id=s20v68 title="Surah 20, Verse 68">We said: "Do not fear, you will best them."</span>
<span class=verse id=s20v69 title="Surah 20, Verse 69">"And cast down what is in your right hand it will consume what they have made. They have only made the plans of a magician, and the magician will not succeed no matter what he does."</span>
<span class=verse id=s20v70 title="Surah 20, Verse 70">So the magicians went down in prostration. They said: "We believe in the Lord of Aaron and Moses."</span>
<span class=verse id=s20v71 title="Surah 20, Verse 71">He said: "Have you believed to him before taking my permission? He is surely your great one who has taught you magic. So, I will cut off your hands and feet from alternate sides, and I will crucify you on the trunks of the palm trees, and you will come to know which of us is greater in retribution and more lasting!"</span>
<span class=verse id=s20v72 title="Surah 20, Verse 72">They said: "We will not prefer you over the proofs that have come to us, and over the One who initiated us. So issue whatever judgment you have, for you only issue judgment in this worldly life."</span>
<span class=verse id=s20v73 title="Surah 20, Verse 73">"We have believed in our Lord that He may forgive us our wrongdoings, and what you had forced us into doing of magic; and God is better and more lasting."</span>
<span class=verse id=s20v74 title="Surah 20, Verse 74">He who comes to his Lord as a criminal, he will have Hell, where he will neither die in it nor live.</span>
<span class=verse id=s20v75 title="Surah 20, Verse 75">And he who comes to Him as a believer doing good works, for those will be the highest ranks.</span>
<span class=verse id=s20v76 title="Surah 20, Verse 76">Gardens of delight, with rivers flowing beneath them, abiding therein. Such is the reward of he who is developed.</span>
<span class=verse id=s20v77 title="Surah 20, Verse 77">And We inspired to Moses: "Take My servants out, and strike for them a path through the sea that is dry. You shall not fear being overtaken, nor be concerned."</span>
<span class=verse id=s20v78 title="Surah 20, Verse 78">So Pharaoh followed them with his soldiers, but the sea cameover them and covered them.</span>
<span class=verse id=s20v79 title="Surah 20, Verse 79">Thus, Pharaoh misled his people and he did not guide.</span>
<span class=verse id=s20v80 title="Surah 20, Verse 80">O Children of Israel, We have saved you from your enemy, and We summoned you at the right side of the mount, and We sent down to you manna and quail.</span>
<span class=verse id=s20v81 title="Surah 20, Verse 81">Eat from the good things that We have provided for you and do not transgress in this else My wrath will be upon you. Whoever has incurred My wrath is lost.</span>
<span class=verse id=s20v82 title="Surah 20, Verse 82">And I am forgiving for whoever repents and does good works, then is guided.</span>
<span class=verse id=s20v83 title="Surah 20, Verse 83">"And what has caused you to rush ahead of your people O Moses?"</span>
<span class=verse id=s20v84 title="Surah 20, Verse 84">He said: "They are coming in my tracks, and I came quickly to you my Lord so you would be pleased."</span>
<span class=verse id=s20v85 title="Surah 20, Verse 85">He said: "We have tested your people after you left, and the Sumerian misguided them."</span>
<span class=verse id=s20v86 title="Surah 20, Verse 86">So Moses returned to his people angry and disappointed. He said: "My people, did not your Lord promise you a good promise? Has the waiting for the pledge been too long, or did you want that the wrath of your Lord be upon you? Thus you broke the promise with me."</span>
<span class=verse id=s20v87 title="Surah 20, Verse 87">They said: "We did not break the promise by our own will, but we were loaded down with the jewelry of the people so we cast them down, and it was such that the Sumerian suggested."</span>
<span class=verse id=s20v88 title="Surah 20, Verse 88">He then produced for them a sculpture of a calf that emitted a cry. So they said: "This is your god and the god of Moses, but he had forgotten!"</span>
<span class=verse id=s20v89 title="Surah 20, Verse 89">Did they not see that it did not respond to them? Nor did it possess for them any harm or benefit?</span>
<span class=verse id=s20v90 title="Surah 20, Verse 90">And Aaron said to them before: "My people, you are being tested with it. Your Lord is the Almighty, so follow me and obey my command!"</span>
<span class=verse id=s20v91 title="Surah 20, Verse 91">They said: "We will remain devoted to it until Moses comes back to us."</span>
<span class=verse id=s20v92 title="Surah 20, Verse 92">He said: "O Aaron, what prevented you when you saw them being astray?"</span>
<span class=verse id=s20v93 title="Surah 20, Verse 93">"Do you not follow me? Have you disobeyed my command?"</span>
<span class=verse id=s20v94 title="Surah 20, Verse 94">He said: "O son of my mother, do not grab me by my beard nor by my head. I was concerned that you would say that I separated between the Children of Israel, and that I did not follow your orders."</span>
<span class=verse id=s20v95 title="Surah 20, Verse 95">He said: "So what do you have to say O Sumerian?"</span>
<span class=verse id=s20v96 title="Surah 20, Verse 96">He said: "I noticed what they did not notice, so I took a handful from where the messenger was standing, and I cast it in. This is what my soul inspired me to do."</span>
<span class=verse id=s20v97 title="Surah 20, Verse 97">He said: "Then be gone, for you will have it in this life to say: "I am not to be touched" And you will have an appointed time which you will not forsake. And look to your god that you remained devoted to, we will burn him, then we will destroy him in the sea completely."</span>
<span class=verse id=s20v98 title="Surah 20, Verse 98">Surely your god is God; for which there is no god except He. His knowledge encompasses all things.</span>
<span class=verse id=s20v99 title="Surah 20, Verse 99">And it is such that We tell to you the news of what  has passed. And We have given you from Us a remembrance.</span>
<span class=verse id=s20v100 title="Surah 20, Verse 100">Whoever turns away from it, then he will carry a load on the Day of Resurrection.</span>
<span class=verse id=s20v101 title="Surah 20, Verse 101">They will remain therein; and miserable for them on the Day of Resurrection is what they carry.</span>
<span class=verse id=s20v102 title="Surah 20, Verse 102">The Day the horn is blown, and We gather the criminals on that Day white eyed.</span>
<span class=verse id=s20v103 title="Surah 20, Verse 103">They whisper among themselves: "You have only been away for a period of ten."</span>
<span class=verse id=s20v104 title="Surah 20, Verse 104">We are fully aware of what they say, for the best among them will say: "No, you have only been away for a day."</span>
<span class=verse id=s20v105 title="Surah 20, Verse 105">And they ask you about the mountains, so say: "My Lord will annihilate them completely."</span>
<span class=verse id=s20v106 title="Surah 20, Verse 106">"Then He will leave it as a smooth plain."</span>
<span class=verse id=s20v107 title="Surah 20, Verse 107">"You will not see in it any crookedness or curves."</span>
<span class=verse id=s20v108 title="Surah 20, Verse 108">On that Day, they will follow the caller, there is no crookedness to him. And all voices will be humbled for the Almighty, you will not be able to hear except whispers.</span>
<span class=verse id=s20v109 title="Surah 20, Verse 109">On that Day, no intercession will be of help, except for he whom the Almighty allows and accepts what he has to say.</span>
<span class=verse id=s20v110 title="Surah 20, Verse 110">He knows their present and their future, and they do not have any of His knowledge.</span>
<span class=verse id=s20v111 title="Surah 20, Verse 111">And the faces shall be humbled for the Living, the Eternal. And whoever carried wickedness with him has failed.</span>
<span class=verse id=s20v112 title="Surah 20, Verse 112">And whoever does any good works, while he is a believer, then he should not fear injustice nor being given less than his due.</span>
<span class=verse id=s20v113 title="Surah 20, Verse 113">And it was such that We sent it down an Arabic revelation, and We dispatched in it the warnings, perhaps they will become aware or it will cause them to remember.</span>
<span class=verse id=s20v114 title="Surah 20, Verse 114">hen High above all is God, the King, the True. And do not be hasty with the Qur'an before its inspiration is completed to you, and say: "My Lord, increase my knowledge."</span>
<span class=verse id=s20v115 title="Surah 20, Verse 115">And We had entrusted to Adam from before, but he  forgot, and We did not find in him the will power.</span>
<span class=verse id=s20v116 title="Surah 20, Verse 116">And We said to the angels: "Yield to Adam." They all yielded except for Satan, he refused.</span>
<span class=verse id=s20v117 title="Surah 20, Verse 117">So We said: "O Adam, this is an enemy to you and your mate. So do not let him take you out from the paradise, else you will have hardship."</span>
<span class=verse id=s20v118 title="Surah 20, Verse 118">"You will have in it that you will not go hungry nor need clothes."</span>
<span class=verse id=s20v119 title="Surah 20, Verse 119">"And you will have in it that you will not go thirsty nor suffer from heat."</span>
<span class=verse id=s20v120 title="Surah 20, Verse 120">But the devil whispered to him, he said: "O Adam, shall I lead you to the tree of immortality and a kingdom which will not waste away?"</span>
<span class=verse id=s20v121 title="Surah 20, Verse 121">So they both ate from it, and their bodies became apparent to them, and they began to place leaves on themselves from the paradise. Adam had disobeyed his Lord, and had gone astray.</span>
<span class=verse id=s20v122 title="Surah 20, Verse 122">Then his Lord recalled him, and He forgave him, and gave guidance to him.</span>
<span class=verse id=s20v123 title="Surah 20, Verse 123">He said: "Descend from this, all of you, for you are enemies to one another. So, when My guidance comes to you, then, whoever follows My guidance, he will not go astray nor suffer."</span>

<span class=verse id=s20v127 title="Surah 20, Verse 127">And it is such that We recompense he who transgresses, and did not believe in the revelations of his Lord. And the retribution of the Hereafter is more severe and more lasting.</span>
<span class=verse id=s20v128 title="Surah 20, Verse 128">Is it not a guide to them how many generations We had destroyed before them, which they are walking now in their homes? In that are signs for the people of understanding.</span>

<span class=verse id=s24v0 title="Surah 24, Verse 0"><em>In the name of God, the Almighty, the Merciful.</em></span>
<span class=verse id=s24v1 title="Surah 24, Verse 1">A Chapter which We have sent down and imposed, and We have sent down in it clear revelations that you may remember.</span>
<span class=verse id=s24v2 title="Surah 24, Verse 2">The adulteress and the adulterer, you shall lash each of them with one hundred lashes, and do not let any pity overtake you regarding the system of God if you believe in God and the Last Day. And let a group of the believers witness their punishment.</span>
<span class=verse id=s24v3 title="Surah 24, Verse 3">The adulterer will only marry an adulteress or she who is a polytheist. And the adulteress, she will only be married to an adulterer or he who is a polytheist. And such has been made forbidden for the believers.</span>
<span class=verse id=s24v4 title="Surah 24, Verse 4">And those who accuse the independent females, then they do not bring forth four witnesses, you shall lash them with eighty lashes, and do not accept their testimony ever; and those are the wicked.</span>
<span class=verse id=s24v5 title="Surah 24, Verse 5">Except those who repent after this and do good, then God is Forgiving, Merciful.</span>
<span class=verse id=s24v6 title="Surah 24, Verse 6">And those who accuse their spouses, but they have no witnesses except for themselves, then the testimony of one of them is to be equivalent to that of four witnesses if it is sworn by God that he is being truthful.</span>
<span class=verse id=s24v7 title="Surah 24, Verse 7">And the fifth shall be the curse of God upon him if he is of the liars.</span>
<span class=verse id=s24v8 title="Surah 24, Verse 8">And the punishment will be averted from her if she bears witness four times by God that he is of the liars.</span>
<span class=verse id=s24v9 title="Surah 24, Verse 9">And the fifth shall be the curse of God upon her if he is speaking the truth.</span>
<span class=verse id=s24v10 title="Surah 24, Verse 10">All this is from the grace of God upon you and His mercy. And God is Forgiving, Wise.</span>
<span class=verse id=s24v11 title="Surah 24, Verse 11">Those who have brought forth the false accusation were a group from among you. Do not think it is bad for you, for it is good for you. Every person among them will have what he deserves of the sin. And as for he who had the greatest portion of it, he will have a great retribution.</span>
<span class=verse id=s24v12 title="Surah 24, Verse 12">If only when you heard it the believing males and the believing females should have thought good of their own selves and said: "This is an obvious lie!"</span>
<span class=verse id=s24v13 title="Surah 24, Verse 13">If only they had brought four witnesses to it. If they did not have the witnesses, then these with God are the liars.</span>
<span class=verse id=s24v14 title="Surah 24, Verse 14">And had it not been for the grace of God upon you, and His mercy in this world and the Hereafter, a great retribution would have touched you for what you have spoken.</span>
<span class=verse id=s24v15 title="Surah 24, Verse 15">For you have cast it with your tongues, and you say with your mouths what you have no knowledge of, and you think it is a minor issue, while with God it was great.</span>
<span class=verse id=s24v16 title="Surah 24, Verse 16">And when you heard it you should have said: "It was not right for us to speak of this. Glory be to You, this is a great lie."</span>
<span class=verse id=s24v17 title="Surah 24, Verse 17">God warns you not to repeat something similar to this ever, if you are believers.</span>
<span class=verse id=s24v18 title="Surah 24, Verse 18">And God clarifies for you the revelations; and God is Knower, Wise.</span>
<span class=verse id=s24v19 title="Surah 24, Verse 19">As for those who enjoy that immorality spreads among those who have believed, they will have a painful retribution in the world and the Hereafter. And God knows while you do not know.</span>
<span class=verse id=s24v20 title="Surah 24, Verse 20">And all this is from the favor of God upon you and His mercy. And God is Compassionate, Merciful.</span>
<span class=verse id=s24v21 title="Surah 24, Verse 21">O you who believe, do not follow the footsteps of the devil. And whoever follows the footsteps of the devil should know that he advocates immorality and vice. And had it not been for the grace of God upon you and His mercy, not one of you would have ever been purified, but God purifies whom He wishes, and God is Hearer, Knower.</span>
<span class=verse id=s24v22 title="Surah 24, Verse 22">And let not those among you who have been blessed by abundance refuse to give to the relatives, and the needy, and those who have immigrated in the cause of God. Let them pardon and forgive. Would you not like God to forgive you? And God is Forgiving, Merciful.</span>
<span class=verse id=s24v23 title="Surah 24, Verse 23">Surely, those who accuse the independent innocent believing females, they will be cursed in this world and the Hereafter, and they will have a painful retribution.</span>
<span class=verse id=s24v24 title="Surah 24, Verse 24">On the Day when their tongues, and their hands, and their feet will bear witness against them for what they used to do.</span>
<span class=verse id=s24v25 title="Surah 24, Verse 25">On that Day, God will pay them what they are owed in full, and they will know that God is the Truth Manifested.</span>
<span class=verse id=s24v26 title="Surah 24, Verse 26">The wicked females are for the wicked males, and the wicked males are for the wicked females. And the good females are for the good males, and the good males are for the good females; these are innocent from what statements have been made, and for them is forgiveness and a generous provision.</span>
<span class=verse id=s24v27 title="Surah 24, Verse 27">O you who believe, do not enter any homes except your own unless you perceive a welcome and you greet the people in them. This is best for you, perhaps you will remember.</span>
<span class=verse id=s24v28 title="Surah 24, Verse 28">But, if you do not find anyone in them then do not enter until you are given permission. And if you are told: "Go back," then go back for it is better for you. And God is aware of what you do.</span>
<span class=verse id=s24v29 title="Surah 24, Verse 29">There is no sin upon you that you enter homes which are abandoned if in them there are belongings of yours. And God knows what you reveal and what you hold back.</span>
<span class=verse id=s24v30 title="Surah 24, Verse 30">Tell the believing men to lower their gaze and keep covered their private parts, for that is better for them. God is fully aware of what you do.</span>
<span class=verse id=s24v31 title="Surah 24, Verse 31">And tell the believing females to lower their gaze and keep covered their private parts, and that they should not reveal their beauty except what is apparent, and let them put forth their shawls over their cleavage. And let them not reveal their beauty except to their husbands, or their fathers, or fathers of their husbands, or their sons, or the sons of their husbands, or their brothers, or the sons of their brothers, or the sons of their sisters, or their women, or those maintained by their oaths, or the male servants who are without need, or  the child who has not yet understood the composition of women. And let them not strike with their feet in a manner that reveals what they are keeping hidden of their beauty. And repent to God, all of you believers, that you may succeed.</span>
<span class=verse id=s24v32 title="Surah 24, Verse 32">And marry off those among you that are single, and the good from among your male and female servants. If they are poor, then God will grant them from His grace. And God is Encompassing, Knowledgeable.</span>
<span class=verse id=s24v33 title="Surah 24, Verse 33">And let those who are not able to marry continue to be chaste until God enriches them of His Bounty. And if those who are maintained by your oaths seek to consummate the marriage, then document it with them if you find that they are ready, and give them from the wealth of God which He has bestowed upon you. And do not force your young women to need if they have desired to be independent, in order that you may make a gain in the goods of this worldly life. And if anyone has compelled them, then for their compulsion, God is Forgiving, Merciful.</span>
<span class=verse id=s24v34 title="Surah 24, Verse 34">And We have sent down to you clarifying revelations and an example of those who came before you and a lesson for the righteous.</span>
<span class=verse id=s24v35 title="Surah 24, Verse 35">God is the Light of the heavens and the earth. The example of His light is like a niche within which there is a lamp, the lamp is encased in a glass, the glass is like a radiant planet, which is lit from a blessed olive tree that is neither of the east nor of the west, its oil nearly gives off light even if not touched by fire. Light upon light, God guides to His light whom He pleases. And God sets forth examples for the people, and God is aware of all things.</span>
<span class=verse id=s24v36 title="Surah 24, Verse 36">In homes that God has permitted to be raised, and His name mentioned in them. He is glorified therein in the mornings and the evenings.</span>
<span class=verse id=s24v37 title="Surah 24, Verse 37">By men not distracted by trade or sale from the remembrance of God and holding the contact prayer, and contributing towards purification. They fear a Day when the hearts and sight will be overturned.</span>
<span class=verse id=s24v38 title="Surah 24, Verse 38">God will reward them for the best of what they did, and He will increase them from His grace. And God provides for whom He wishes without reckoning.</span>
<span class=verse id=s24v39 title="Surah 24, Verse 39">As for those who reject, their works are like a mirage in the desert. A thirsty person thinks it is water, until he reaches it, he finds it is nothing; and he finds God there and He pays him his due, and God is swift in judgment.</span>
<span class=verse id=s24v40 title="Surah 24, Verse 40">Or like the darkness out in a deep ocean in the midst of violent waves, with waves upon waves and dark clouds. Darkness upon darkness, if he brings out his own hand, he could barely see it. And for whoever God does not make a light, he will have no light.</span>
<span class=verse id=s24v41 title="Surah 24, Verse 41">Do you not see that everything in the heavens and the earth glorifies God? Even the birds in formation, each knows its contact prayer and its glorification. And God is fully aware of everything they do.</span>
<span class=verse id=s24v42 title="Surah 24, Verse 42">And to God is the sovereignty of the heavens and the earth, and to God is the final destiny.</span>
<span class=verse id=s24v43 title="Surah 24, Verse 43">Do you not see that God drives the clouds, then He joins them together, then He makes them into a stack; so you see the soft rain coming out of them? And He sends down hail from the sky from mountains, so He strikes with it whoever He wills, and He diverts it from whoever He wills; the vivid flash of its lightning almost blinds the eyes.</span>
<span class=verse id=s24v44 title="Surah 24, Verse 44">God rotates the night and the day. In that is a lesson for those who have insight.</span>
<span class=verse id=s24v45 title="Surah 24, Verse 45">And God created every moving creature from water. So some of them move on their bellies, and some walk on two legs, and some walk on four. God creates whatever He wills. God is capable of all things.</span>
<span class=verse id=s24v46 title="Surah 24, Verse 46">We have sent down to you clarifying revelations, and God guides whoever He wills to a straight path.</span>
<span class=verse id=s24v47 title="Surah 24, Verse 47">And they say: "We believe in God and in the messenger, and we obey," but a group of them turn away after that. These are not believers.</span>
<span class=verse id=s24v48 title="Surah 24, Verse 48">And if they are invited to God and His messenger to judge between them, a party of them turn away.</span>
<span class=verse id=s24v49 title="Surah 24, Verse 49">But, if the judgment is in their favor, they come to him readily!</span>
<span class=verse id=s24v50 title="Surah 24, Verse 50">Is there a disease in their hearts, or are they doubtful? Or do they fear that God and His messenger would wrong them in the judgment? In fact, they are the wrong doers.</span>
<span class=verse id=s24v51 title="Surah 24, Verse 51">The utterance of the believers when they are invited to God and His messenger to judge in their affairs is to say: "We hear and obey." These are the winners.</span>
<span class=verse id=s24v52 title="Surah 24, Verse 52">And whoever obeys God and His messenger, and is concerned by God, and aware of Him, then these are the winners.</span>
<span class=verse id=s24v53 title="Surah 24, Verse 53">And they swear by God with their strongest oaths that if you would only command them they would mobilize. Say: "Do not swear, for obedience is an obligation. God is Expert over what you do."</span>
<span class=verse id=s24v54 title="Surah 24, Verse 54">Say: "Obey God, and obey the messenger." But if they turn away, then he is only responsible for his obligation, and you are responsible for your obligations. And if you obey him, you will be guided. The messenger is only required to deliver clearly.</span>
<span class=verse id=s24v55 title="Surah 24, Verse 55">God promises those among you who believe and do good works, that He will make them successors on the earth, as He made successors of those before them, and He will enable for them their system which He has approved for them, and He will substitute security for them in place of fear: "That they serve Me, not setting up anything with Me." And as for those who reject after that, these are the wicked.</span>
<span class=verse id=s24v56 title="Surah 24, Verse 56">And hold the contact prayer and contribute towards purification, and obey the messenger, that you may attain mercy.</span>
<span class=verse id=s24v57 title="Surah 24, Verse 57">Do not think that those who disbelieve will remain in the land. Their abode is Hell. What a miserable destiny!</span>
<span class=verse id=s24v58 title="Surah 24, Verse 58">O you who believe, let those among you who are maintained by your oaths, and those who have not attained puberty, request your permission regarding three times: before the dawn contact prayer, and when you put off your garments from the noon time, and after the evening contact prayer. These are three private times for you. Other than these times, it is not wrong for you or them to intermingle with one another. God thus clarifies the revelations for you. And God is Knowledgeable, Wise.</span>
<span class=verse id=s24v59 title="Surah 24, Verse 59">And when your children reach puberty, then let them seek your permission like it was sought by those before them. God thus clarifies His revelations for you. And God is Knowledgeable, Wise.</span>
<span class=verse id=s24v60 title="Surah 24, Verse 60">And the women who are past child bearing, who no longer seek to get married, have no sin upon them if they put off their garments, provided they are not adorned for beauty. And if they remain as they were, then it is better for them. God is Hearer, Knower.</span>
<span class=verse id=s24v61 title="Surah 24, Verse 61">There is no blame upon the blind, nor is there any blame upon the crippled, nor is there any blame upon the ill, nor is there any blame upon yourselves, if you eat at your homes, or the homes of your fathers, or the homes of your mothers, or the homes of your brothers, or the homes of your sisters, or the homes of your uncles, or the homes of your aunts, or the homes of your mothers brothers, or the homes of your mothers sisters, or that which you possess their keys, or that of your friends. You commit nothing wrong by eating together or as individuals. When you enter any home, you shall greet each other a greeting from God that is blessed and good. God thus explains the revelations for you that you may comprehend.</span>
<span class=verse id=s24v62 title="Surah 24, Verse 62">The believers are those who believe in God and His messenger, and when they are with him in a meeting, they do not leave him without permission. Those who ask permission are the ones who do believe in God and His messenger. If they ask your permission, in order to attend to some of their affairs, you may grant permission to whoever you wish, and ask God to forgive them. God is Forgiver, Merciful.</span>
<span class=verse id=s24v63 title="Surah 24, Verse 63">Do not let the calling of the messenger between you be as if you are calling each other. God is fully aware of those among you who slip away under flimsy excuses. Let those who oppose his command beware, for an ordeal may strike them, or a painful retribution.</span>
<span class=verse id=s24v64 title="Surah 24, Verse 64">Certainly, to God belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth. Surely, He knows what your condition is; and on the Day when they are returned to Him, He will inform them of everything they had done. God is aware of all things.</span>

<span class=verse id=s27v56 title="Surah 27, Verse 56">But the reply of his people was that they said: "Expel the family of Lot from your town, for they are a people who are being pure!"</span>
<span class=verse id=s27v57 title="Surah 27, Verse 57">So We saved him and his family, except for his wife; We found her to be of those doomed.</span>

<span class=verse id=s27v59 title="Surah 27, Verse 59">Say: "Praise be to God, and peace be upon His servants whom He has selected." Is God better, or that which you set up?</span>
<span class=verse id=s27v60 title="Surah 27, Verse 60">The One who has created the heavens and the earth, and He sent down water from the sky for you, so We cause gardens to grow with it that are full of beauty.

<span class=verse id=s27v61 title="Surah 27, Verse 61">The One who made the earth a habitat, and He made in it rivers and He made for it stabilizers, and He made between the two seas a barrier. Is there a god with God? No. But most of them do not know.</span>

<span class=verse id=s27v64 title="Surah 27, Verse 64">The One who initiates the creation then He returns it, and He provides for you from the sky and the land. Is there a god with God? Say: "Bring your proof if you are being truthful."</span>
<span class=verse id=s27v65 title="Surah 27, Verse 65">Say: "None in the heavens or the earth know the unseen except God. And they do not perceive when they will be resurrected."</span>
<span class=verse id=s27v66 title="Surah 27, Verse 66">No, they have no knowledge of the Hereafter. No, they are in doubt regarding it. No, they are blind to it.</span>

<span class=verse id=s28v0 title="Surah 28, Verse 0"><em>In the name of God, the Almighty, the Merciful.</em></span>
<span class=verse id=s28v1 title="Surah 28, Verse 1">T'SM.</span>
<span class=verse id=s28v2 title="Surah 28, Verse 2">These are the signs of the clear Book.</span>
<span class=verse id=s28v3 title="Surah 28, Verse 3">We recite to you from the news of Moses and Pharaoh with fact, for a people who believe.</span>
<span class=verse id=s28v4 title="Surah 28, Verse 4">Pharaoh became mighty in the land, and he turned its people into factions; he oppressed a group of them by killing their children and raping their women. He was of those who corrupted.</span>
<span class=verse id=s28v5 title="Surah 28, Verse 5">And We wanted to help those who were oppressed in the land, and to make them leaders, and to make them the inheritors.</span>
<span class=verse id=s28v6 title="Surah 28, Verse 6">And to enable them in the land, and to show Pharaoh and Haamaan and their troops what they had feared.</span>
<span class=verse id=s28v7 title="Surah 28, Verse 7">And We inspired to Moses' mother: "Suckle him, and when you become fearful for him, then cast him off in the sea, and do not fear nor grieve. We will return him to you and We will make him of the messengers."</span>
<span class=verse id=s28v8 title="Surah 28, Verse 8">Then the family of Pharaoh picked him up, so he would be an enemy to them and a source of sadness. Certainly, Pharaoh and Haamaan and their troops were wrongdoers.</span>
<span class=verse id=s28v9 title="Surah 28, Verse 9">And the wife of Pharaoh said: "A pleasure to my eye and yours, so do not kill him, perhaps he will benefit us or we may take him as a son;" while they did not perceive.</span>
<span class=verse id=s28v10 title="Surah 28, Verse 10">And the heart of Moses' mother became anxious, that she nearly revealed her identity. But We strengthened her heart, so that she would be of the believers.</span>
<span class=verse id=s28v11 title="Surah 28, Verse 11">And she said to his sister: "Follow his path." So she watched him from afar, while they did not notice.</span>
<span class=verse id=s28v12 title="Surah 28, Verse 12">And We forbade him from accepting all the nursing mothers. Then his sister said: "Shall I lead you to a household that can nurse him for you, and take good care of him?"</span>
<span class=verse id=s28v13 title="Surah 28, Verse 13">Thus, We returned him to his mother, so that she may be pleased and not be saddened, and to let her know that the promise of God is the truth. However, most of them do not know.</span>
<span class=verse id=s28v14 title="Surah 28, Verse 14">And when he reached his independence and was established, We bestowed him with wisdom and knowledge. We thus reward the good doers.</span>
<span class=verse id=s28v15 title="Surah 28, Verse 15">And he entered the city unexpectedly, without being noticed by the people. He found in it two men who were fighting, one was from his clan, and the other was from that of his enemy. So the one who was from his clan called on him for help against his enemy, whereby Moses punched him, killing him. He said: "This is from the work of the devil; he is an enemy that clearly misleads."</span>
<span class=verse id=s28v16 title="Surah 28, Verse 16">He said: "My Lord, I have wronged my soul, so forgive me." He then forgave him, for He is the Forgiver, the Merciful.</span>
<span class=verse id=s28v17 title="Surah 28, Verse 17">He said: "My Lord, for what blessings you have bestowed upon me, I will never be a supporter for the criminals."</span>
<span class=verse id=s28v18 title="Surah 28, Verse 18">So he spent the night in the city, afraid and watchful. Then the one who sought his help yesterday, was asking again for his help. Moses said to him: "You are clearly a trouble maker."</span>
<span class=verse id=s28v19 title="Surah 28, Verse 19">But when he was about to strike their mutual enemy, he said: "O Moses, do you want to kill me, as you killed that person yesterday? Obviously, you wish to be a tyrant on the earth; you do not wish to be of the righteous."</span>
<span class=verse id=s28v20 title="Surah 28, Verse 20">And a man came running from the farthest part of the city, saying: "O Moses, the commanders are plotting to kill you, so leave immediately. I am giving you good advice."</span>
<span class=verse id=s28v21 title="Surah 28, Verse 21">He exited the city, afraid and watchful. He said: "My Lord, save me from the wicked people."</span>
<span class=verse id=s28v22 title="Surah 28, Verse 22">And as he traveled towards Midyan, he said: "Perhaps my Lord will guide me to the right path."</span>
<span class=verse id=s28v23 title="Surah 28, Verse 23">When he arrived at the watering hole of Midyan, he found a crowd of people watering, and he found two women waiting on the side. He said: "What is holding you back." They said: "We cannot draw water until the shepherds finish, and our father is an old man."</span>
<span class=verse id=s28v24 title="Surah 28, Verse 24">So he drew water for them, then he turned to a shaded area, and he said: "My Lord, I am poor, lacking any provisions You may have sent down."</span>
<span class=verse id=s28v25 title="Surah 28, Verse 25">So one of the two women approached him, shyly, and said: "My father invites you to reward you for watering for us." So when he came to him, and told to him the stories, he said: "Do not fear, for you have been saved from the wicked people."</span>
<span class=verse id=s28v26 title="Surah 28, Verse 26">One of the two women said: "O my father, hire him. For the best to be hired is one who is strong and honest."</span>
<span class=verse id=s28v27 title="Surah 28, Verse 27">He said: "I wish you to marry one of my two daughters, on condition that you work for me through eight pilgrimage periods; if you complete them to ten, it will be voluntary on your part. I do not wish to make this matter too difficult for you. You will find me, God willing, of the righteous."</span>
<span class=verse id=s28v28 title="Surah 28, Verse 28">He said: "It is then an agreement between me and you. Whichever period I fulfill, you will not be averse to either one. And God is entrusted over what we said."</span>
<span class=verse id=s28v29 title="Surah 28, Verse 29">So after Moses fulfilled his obligation and was traveling with his family, he saw a fire on the slope of the mount. He said to his family: "Stay here, I have seen a fire, perhaps I can bring you from there some news or a burning piece of the fire so that you may be warmed."</span>
<span class=verse id=s28v30 title="Surah 28, Verse 30">So when he reached it, he was called from the edge of the right side of the valley at the blessed area of the tree: "O Moses, it is I, God, Lord of the worlds."</span>
<span class=verse id=s28v31 title="Surah 28, Verse 31">"And cast down your staff." So when he saw it vibrate as if it were a Jinn, he turned around to flee and would not return. "O Moses, come forward and do not be afraid. You are of those who are safe."</span>
<span class=verse id=s28v32 title="Surah 28, Verse 32">"Place your hand into your pocket. It will come out white without any blemish, and fold your hand close to your side against fear. These are two proofs from your Lord, to Pharaoh and his commanders; for they are a wicked people."</span>
<span class=verse id=s28v33 title="Surah 28, Verse 33">He said: "My Lord, I have killed a person from them, so I fear that they will kill me."</span>
<span class=verse id=s28v34 title="Surah 28, Verse 34">"And my brother Aaron is more eloquent in speech than I. So send him with me to help and to confirm me. For I fear that they will deny me."</span>
<span class=verse id=s28v35 title="Surah 28, Verse 35">He said: "We will strengthen you with your brother, and We will provide you both with authority. Thus, they will not be able to touch either one of you. With Our signs, the two of you, along with those who follow you, will be the victors."</span>
<span class=verse id=s28v36 title="Surah 28, Verse 36">So when Moses went to them with Our clear signs, they said: "This is nothing but fabricated magic; nor did we hear of this from our fathers of old!"</span>
<span class=verse id=s28v37 title="Surah 28, Verse 37">And Moses said: "My Lord is fully aware of who has come with the guidance from Him, and who will have the best deal in the Hereafter. The wicked never succeed."</span>
<span class=verse id=s28v38 title="Surah 28, Verse 38">And Pharaoh said: "O commanders, I have not known of any god for you other than me. Therefore, O Haamaan, fire-up the bricks and make for me a high platform, so perhaps I may take a look at the god of Moses; though I think he is one of the liars."</span>
<span class=verse id=s28v39 title="Surah 28, Verse 39">And he and his soldiers were arrogant in the land without any right, and they thought that they would not be returned to Us.</span>
<span class=verse id=s28v40 title="Surah 28, Verse 40">So We took him and his soldiers, and We cast them into the sea. So see how was the end of the wicked!</span>
<span class=verse id=s28v41 title="Surah 28, Verse 41">We made them leaders, inviting to the Fire. And on the Day of Resurrection, they will not be supported.</span>
<span class=verse id=s28v42 title="Surah 28, Verse 42">And We made them followed by a curse in this world, and on the Day of Resurrection they will be despised.</span>
<span class=verse id=s28v43 title="Surah 28, Verse 43">We had given Moses the Book after We had destroyed the earlier generations; as an example for the people and a guidance and a mercy, perhaps they will take heed.</span>
<span class=verse id=s28v44 title="Surah 28, Verse 44">And you were not on the western slope when We decreed the command to Moses. You were not a witness.</span>
<span class=verse id=s28v45 title="Surah 28, Verse 45">And We established many generations, and many ages passed them by. And you were not living among the people of Midyan, reciting Our revelations to them. But We were to send messengers.</span>
<span class=verse id=s28v46 title="Surah 28, Verse 46">And nor were you on the side of the mount when We called. But it is a mercy from your Lord, so that you may warn a people who received no warner before you, perhaps they may take heed.</span>
<span class=verse id=s28v47 title="Surah 28, Verse 47">Thus, if any disaster strikes them as a consequence of their own deeds they cannot Say: "Our Lord, if only You sent a messenger to us, so that we would follow Your revelations, and we would be of the believers."</span>
<span class=verse id=s28v48 title="Surah 28, Verse 48">But when the truth came to them from Us, they said: "If only he was given the same that was given to Moses!" Had they not rejected what was given to Moses before? They had said: "Two magicians assisting one another." And they said: "We reject all these things."</span>
<span class=verse id=s28v49 title="Surah 28, Verse 49">Say: "Then bring forth a book from God that is better than them in guidance so I may follow it, if you are truthful."</span>
<span class=verse id=s28v50 title="Surah 28, Verse 50">But if they fail to respond to you, then know that they follow only their desires. And who is more astray than he who follows his desire, without guidance from God? God does not guide the wicked people.</span>
<span class=verse id=s28v51 title="Surah 28, Verse 51">And We have delivered the message, perhaps they may take heed.</span>
<span class=verse id=s28v52 title="Surah 28, Verse 52">Those to whom We had given the Book before this, they will believe in it.</span>
<span class=verse id=s28v53 title="Surah 28, Verse 53">And if it is recited to them, they say: "We believe in it. It is the truth from our Lord. Indeed, we had submitted before it."</span>
<span class=verse id=s28v54 title="Surah 28, Verse 54">To these We grant twice the reward for that they have been patient. And they counter evil with good, and from Our provisions to them, they give.</span>
<span class=verse id=s28v55 title="Surah 28, Verse 55">And if they come across vain talk, they disregard it and say: "To us are our deeds, and to you are your deeds. Peace be upon you. We do not seek the ignorant."</span>
<span class=verse id=s28v56 title="Surah 28, Verse 56">You cannot guide whom you love. But it is God who guides whom He wills; and He is fully aware of those who receive the guidance.</span>
<span class=verse id=s28v57 title="Surah 28, Verse 57">And they said: "If we follow the guidance with you, we will be deposed from our land." Did We not establish for them a safe territory, to which all kinds of fruits are offered, as a provision from Us? Indeed, most of them do not know.</span>
<span class=verse id=s28v58 title="Surah 28, Verse 58">And how many a town have We destroyed that had become unappreciative of its livelihood. So here are their dwellings, they remained uninhabited after them, except for a few. And We were the inheritors.</span>
<span class=verse id=s28v59 title="Surah 28, Verse 59">And your Lord was not to destroy the towns until He sends  a messenger to their capital, to recite Our revelations to them. And We do not destroy the towns unless its people are wicked.</span>
<span class=verse id=s28v60 title="Surah 28, Verse 60">And anything that is given to you is only the materialism of this world, and its glitter. And what is with God is far better, and more lasting. Do you not comprehend?</span>
<span class=verse id=s28v61 title="Surah 28, Verse 61">Is one whom We promised a good promise, and it will come to pass, equal to one whom We provided with the goods of this life, then on the Day of Resurrection he is of those who will be summoned?</span>
<span class=verse id=s28v62 title="Surah 28, Verse 62">And on the Day when He calls upon them, saying: "Where are My partners whom you used to claim?"</span>
<span class=verse id=s28v63 title="Surah 28, Verse 63">Those who have deserved the retribution will say: "Our Lord, these are the ones we misled; we misled them only because we ourselves were misled. We seek to absolve ourselves to You, it was not us that they worshipped."</span>
<span class=verse id=s28v64 title="Surah 28, Verse 64">And it will be said: "Call upon your partners," but they will not respond to them. And they will see the retribution. If only they were guided!</span>
<span class=verse id=s28v65 title="Surah 28, Verse 65">On that Day, He will ask them and say: "What was the answer you gave to the messengers?"</span>
<span class=verse id=s28v66 title="Surah 28, Verse 66">They will be shocked by the news on that Day, they will be speechless.</span>
<span class=verse id=s28v67 title="Surah 28, Verse 67">As for the one who repents, believes, and does good works; perhaps he will be with the winners.</span>
<span class=verse id=s28v68 title="Surah 28, Verse 68">And your Lord creates what He wills, and He selects; it is not for them to select. Glory be to God, He is far above the partners they set up.</span>
<span class=verse id=s28v69 title="Surah 28, Verse 69">And your Lord knows what is concealed in their chests and what they declare.</span>
<span class=verse id=s28v70 title="Surah 28, Verse 70">And He is God, there is no god except He. To Him belongs all praise in the first and in the last, and judgment belongs with Him, and to Him you will be returned.</span>
<span class=verse id=s28v71 title="Surah 28, Verse 71">Say: "Have you noted: what if God made the night eternal, until the Day of Resurrection? Which god, other than God, can bring you with light? Do you not listen?"</span>
<span class=verse id=s28v72 title="Surah 28, Verse 72">Say: "Have you noted: what if God made the daylight eternal, until the Day of Resurrection? Which god, other than God, can provide you with night for you to reside in? Do you not see?"</span>
<span class=verse id=s28v73 title="Surah 28, Verse 73">And from His mercy is that He created for you the night and the day; that you may reside in it, and that you may seek of His provisions; and perhaps you may be thankful.</span>
<span class=verse id=s28v74 title="Surah 28, Verse 74">And the Day He will call them and say: "Where are My partners whom you had claimed?"</span>
<span class=verse id=s28v75 title="Surah 28, Verse 75">And We will extract from every nation a witness, then We will say: "Bring forth your proof." They will then realize that all truth belongs with God, and what they had invented will abandon them.</span>
<span class=verse id=s28v76 title="Surah 28, Verse 76">Qaroon was from among the people of Moses, but he betrayed them. And We gave him such treasures that the keys thereof were almost too heavy for the strongest person. His people said to him: "Do not glee, for God does not love the gleeful."</span>
<span class=verse id=s28v77 title="Surah 28, Verse 77">"And seek with the provisions bestowed upon you by God the abode of the Hereafter, and do not forget your share in this world, and do good as God has done good to you. And do not seek corruption in the land. God does not love the corrupters."</span>
<span class=verse id=s28v78 title="Surah 28, Verse 78">He said: "I have attained all this only because of my own knowledge." Did he not realize that God had annihilated before him generations that were much stronger than he, and greater in riches? The transgressors were not asked about their crimes.</span>
<span class=verse id=s28v79 title="Surah 28, Verse 79">Then he came out among his people draped in his ornaments. Those who preferred this worldly life said: "Oh, if only we were given similar to what Qaroon has been given. Indeed, he is very fortunate."</span>
<span class=verse id=s28v80 title="Surah 28, Verse 80">And those who were blessed with knowledge said: "Woe to you! The reward from God is far better for those who believe and do good work. And none attains it except the steadfast."</span>
<span class=verse id=s28v81 title="Surah 28, Verse 81">We then caused the earth to swallow him and his mansion. He had no group that could protect him against God; nor would he be victorious.</span>
<span class=verse id=s28v82 title="Surah 28, Verse 82">And those who wished they were in his place the day before said: "Indeed it is God Who provides or restricts for whoever He chooses from among His servants. Had it not been for the grace of God towards us, He could have caused the earth to swallow us as well. We now realize that the rejecters never succeed."</span>
<span class=verse id=s28v83 title="Surah 28, Verse 83">Such will be the abode of the Hereafter; We reserve it for those who do not seek prestige on the earth, nor corruption; and the ending will be for the righteous.</span>
<span class=verse id=s28v84 title="Surah 28, Verse 84">Whoever brings forth a good deed, he will receive a better reward than it. And whoever brings forth a sin then the retribution for their sins will be to the extent of their deeds.</span>

<span class=verse id=s30v5 title="Surah 30, Verse 5">With the victory of God. God gives victory to whom He wishes; He is the Noble, the Merciful.</span>
<span class=verse id=s30v6 title="Surah 30, Verse 6">Such is the pledge of God, and God does not break His pledge, but most of the people do not know.</span>

<span class=verse id=s30v8 title="Surah 30, Verse 8">Did they not reflect upon themselves? God did not create the heavens and the earth and what is between them except with truth and an appointed term. But most of the people are in denial regarding their meeting with their Lord.</span>
<span class=verse id=s30v9 title="Surah 30, Verse 9">Did they not roam the earth and see how it ended for those before them? They were more powerful than them, and they cultivated the land and they built in it far more than these have built, and their messengers came to them with the proofs. God was not to wrong them, but it was they who wronged themselves.</span>
<span class=verse id=s30v10 title="Surah 30, Verse 10">Then the end of those who did evil was evil, that is because they denied the signs of God, and they used to mock them.</span>

Would you fear them as you fear each other? It is such that We clarify the revelations for a people who have sense.</span>
<span class=verse id=s30v29 title="Surah 30, Verse 29">No, those who were wrong followed their desires without knowledge. So who can guide he whom God misguides? And they will have no victors.</span>
<span class=verse id=s30v30 title="Surah 30, Verse 30">So establish yourself to the system of monotheism. It is the inclination that God has nurtured the people on. There is no changing in the creation of God. Such is the pure system, but most of the people do not know.</span>
<span class=verse id=s30v31 title="Surah 30, Verse 31">Turn to Him, and be aware of Him, and hold the contact prayer, and do not be of the polytheists.</span>

<span class=verse id=s30v45 title="Surah 30, Verse 45">So that He will reward those that believe and do good works from His grace. He does not love the rejecters.</span>
<span class=verse id=s30v46 title="Surah 30, Verse 46">And from His signs is that He sends the winds with glad tidings, and to give you a taste of His mercy, and so that the ships may sail by His command, and that you may seek of His bounty; perhaps you will be thankful.</span>
<span class=verse id=s30v47 title="Surah 30, Verse 47">And We have sent before you messengers to their people. So they came to them with clear proofs; then We took revenge on those who were criminals. And it is binding upon Us to grant victory to the believers.</span>
<span class=verse id=s30v48 title="Surah 30, Verse 48">God Who sends the winds, so they raise clouds, and He spreads them in the sky as He wishes, then He turns them into joined pieces, then you see the rain drops come forth from their midst.

<span class=verse id=s31v21 title="Surah 31, Verse 21">And if they are told: "Follow that which God has sent down." They say: "No, we will follow what we found our fathers doing." What if the devil had been leading them to the agony of Hell?</span>

<span class=verse id=s33v1 title="Surah 33, Verse 1">O prophet, you shall be aware of God, and do not obey the rejecters and the hypocrites. God is Knowledgeable, Wise.</span>
<span class=verse id=s33v2 title="Surah 33, Verse 2">And follow what is being inspired to you by your Lord. God is fully aware of all that you do.</span>
<span class=verse id=s33v3 title="Surah 33, Verse 3">And put your trust in God. God suffices as an advocate.</span>
<span class=verse id=s33v4 title="Surah 33, Verse 4">God did not make any man with two hearts in his body. Nor did He make your wives whom you make estranged to be your mothers. Nor did He make your adopted children to be your sons. Such is what you claim with your mouths, but God speaks the truth, and He guides to the path.</span>
<span class=verse id=s33v5 title="Surah 33, Verse 5">Name them by their fathers. That is more just with God. But if you do not know their fathers, then, name them as your brothers in the system and your patrons. There is no sin upon you for what mistake you make in this respect; but you will be responsible for what your hearts deliberately intend. God is Forgiver, Merciful.</span>
<span class=verse id=s33v6 title="Surah 33, Verse 6">The prophet is closer to the believers than themselves, and his wives are mothers to them. And the decree of God to the believers and the emigrants is that before they help their relatives, they have taken care of their own families first. Such has been decreed in the Book.</span>
<span class=verse id=s33v7 title="Surah 33, Verse 7">And when We took from the prophets their covenant. And from you, and from Noah, and Abraham, and Moses, and Jesus, son of Mary; We took from them a solemn covenant.</span>
<span class=verse id=s33v8 title="Surah 33, Verse 8">So that the truthful may be asked about their truthfulness, and He has prepared for the rejecters a painful retribution.</span>
<span class=verse id=s33v9 title="Surah 33, Verse 9">O you who believe, remember the grace of God upon you when soldiers attacked you and We sent upon them a wind and invisible soldiers. God is Seer of what you do.</span>
<span class=verse id=s33v10 title="Surah 33, Verse 10">For they came from above you, and from beneath you; and your eyes were terrified, and the hearts reached to the throat, and you harbored doubts about God.</span>
<span class=verse id=s33v11 title="Surah 33, Verse 11">That is when the believers were truly tested; they were severely shaken up.</span>
<span class=verse id=s33v12 title="Surah 33, Verse 12">And the hypocrites and those who have a sickness in their hearts said: "God and His messenger promised us nothing but delusion!"</span>
<span class=verse id=s33v13 title="Surah 33, Verse 13">And a group of them said: "O people of Yathrib, there is no station for you, so come back." And a small party of them sought permission from the prophet, saying: "Our homes are exposed," while they were not exposed. They just wanted to flee.</span>
<span class=verse id=s33v14 title="Surah 33, Verse 14">And if the enemy had entered at them from all sides, and then they were asked to betray, they would do so with very little hesitation.</span>
<span class=verse id=s33v15 title="Surah 33, Verse 15">And indeed they had pledged to God before this that they would not turn around and flee; and making a pledge to God brings great responsibility.</span>
<span class=verse id=s33v16 title="Surah 33, Verse 16">Say: "It will not benefit you to flee away from death or from being killed, for you will only have the enjoyment for a short while."</span>
<span class=verse id=s33v17 title="Surah 33, Verse 17">Say: "Who can protect you from God if He intends to harm you, or He intends any blessing for you?" They will never find besides God any ally or victor.</span>
<span class=verse id=s33v18 title="Surah 33, Verse 18">God already knows which of you are the hinderers, and those who say to their brothers: "Come and stay with us." Rarely do they mobilize for battle.</span>
<span class=verse id=s33v19 title="Surah 33, Verse 19">They are miserable towards you. Then, when fear comes, you see their eyes rolling, as if death had already come to them. But once the fear is gone, they lash out at you with sharp tongues. They are miserable towards doing any good. These have not believed, so God nullifies their works. This is easy for God to do.</span>
<span class=verse id=s33v20 title="Surah 33, Verse 20">They thought that the Confederates had not yet mobilized. And if the Confederates do appear, they wish that they were out with the Nomads, seeking out news for you. Even if they were among you, they would not have fought except very little.</span>
<span class=verse id=s33v21 title="Surah 33, Verse 21">Indeed, in the messenger of God a good example has been set for you for he who seeks God and the Last Day and thinks constantly about God.</span>
<span class=verse id=s33v22 title="Surah 33, Verse 22">And when the believers saw the Confederates, they said: "This is what God and His messenger have promised us, and God and His messenger are truthful." This only increased their faith and their submission.</span>
<span class=verse id=s33v23 title="Surah 33, Verse 23">From among the believers are men who fulfilled their pledge to God. Thus, some of them have passed away, while some are still waiting; but they never altered in the least.</span>
<span class=verse id=s33v24 title="Surah 33, Verse 24">That God may recompense the truthful for their truthfulness, and punish the hypocrites if He so wills, or accepts their repentance. God is Forgiver, Merciful.</span>
<span class=verse id=s33v25 title="Surah 33, Verse 25">And God drove back those who disbelieved with their rage, they left empty handed. God thus spared the believers any fighting. God is Powerful, Noble.</span>
<span class=verse id=s33v26 title="Surah 33, Verse 26">And He also brought down those who helped support them from among the people of the Book from their secure positions, and He threw terror into their hearts. Some of them you killed, and some you took captive.</span>
<span class=verse id=s33v27 title="Surah 33, Verse 27">And He made you inherit their lands, and their homes, and their money, and lands you had never stepped on; and God is able to do all things.</span>
<span class=verse id=s33v28 title="Surah 33, Verse 28">O prophet, say to your wives: "If you are seeking this worldly life and its vanities, then come, I will make a provision for you and release you in an amicable manner."</span>
<span class=verse id=s33v29 title="Surah 33, Verse 29">"But if you are seeking God and His messenger, and the abode of the Hereafter, then God has prepared for the righteous among you a great reward."</span>
<span class=verse id=s33v30 title="Surah 33, Verse 30">O women of the prophet, if any of you commits evident immorality, then her retribution will be doubled. This is easy for God to do.</span>
<span class=verse id=s33v31 title="Surah 33, Verse 31">And any of you who is devoted to God and His messenger, and does good works, We will grant her double the recompense, and We have prepared for her a generous provision.</span>
<span class=verse id=s33v32 title="Surah 33, Verse 32">O women of the prophet, you are not like any other women. If you are righteous, then do not speak too softly, lest those with disease in their hearts will move with desire; you shall speak in an honorable manner.</span>
<span class=verse id=s33v33 title="Surah 33, Verse 33">You shall be content in your homes, and do not show off like in the old days of ignorance. You shall hold the contact prayer, and contribute towards purification, and obey God and His messenger. God wishes to remove any taint from you, O family of the Shrine, and to purify you completely.</span>
<span class=verse id=s33v34 title="Surah 33, Verse 34">And recall all that is being recited in your homes of the revelations of God and the wisdom. God is Sublime, Expert.</span>
<span class=verse id=s33v35 title="Surah 33, Verse 35">Surely, the submitting males, and the submitting females, the believing males, and the believing females, the devout males, and the devout females, the truthful males, and the truthful females, the patient males, and the patient females, the humble males, and the humble females, the charitable males, and the charitable females, the fasting males, and the fasting females, the males who keep covered their private parts, and the females who similarly keep covered, and the males who commemorate God frequently, and the commemorating females; God has prepared for them a forgiveness and a great recompense.</span>
<span class=verse id=s33v36 title="Surah 33, Verse 36">It is not for a believing male or believing female, if God and His messenger issue any command, that they have any choice in their decision. And anyone who disobeys God and His messenger, he has gone far astray.</span>
<span class=verse id=s33v37 title="Surah 33, Verse 37">And you said to the one who was blessed by God, and blessed by you: "Keep your wife and reverence God," and you hid inside yourself what God wished to proclaim. And you were concerned with the people, while God was more deserving that you be concerned with. So when Zayd ended his relationship with his wife, We had you marry her, to establish that there is no wrongdoing for the believers in marrying the wives of their adopted sons if their relationship is ended. And the command of God is always done.</span>
<span class=verse id=s33v38 title="Surah 33, Verse 38">There is no blame on the prophet in doing anything that God has decreed upon him. Such was the way of God with the people of old. And the command of God is a determined duty.</span>
<span class=verse id=s33v39 title="Surah 33, Verse 39">Those who deliver the messages of God, and are concerned towards Him, and they are not concerned towards anyone except God. God suffices as a Reckoner.</span>
<span class=verse id=s33v40 title="Surah 33, Verse 40">Mohammed is not the father of any of your men, but he is the messenger of God and the seal of the prophets. And God is fully aware of all things.</span>
<span class=verse id=s33v41 title="Surah 33, Verse 41">O you who believe, you shall remember God frequently.</span>
<span class=verse id=s33v42 title="Surah 33, Verse 42">And glorify Him morning and evening.</span>
<span class=verse id=s33v43 title="Surah 33, Verse 43">He is the One who makes contact with you, along with His angels, to bring you out of darkness and into the light. And He is ever Merciful towards the believers.</span>
<span class=verse id=s33v44 title="Surah 33, Verse 44">Their greeting the Day they meet Him is: "Peace" and He has prepared for them a generous recompense.</span>
<span class=verse id=s33v45 title="Surah 33, Verse 45">O prophet, We have sent you as a witness, and a bearer of good news, and a warner.</span>
<span class=verse id=s33v46 title="Surah 33, Verse 46">Inviting to God, with His permission, and an illuminating lamp.</span>
<span class=verse id=s33v47 title="Surah 33, Verse 47">And give good news to the believers, that they have deserved from God a great blessing.</span>
<span class=verse id=s33v48 title="Surah 33, Verse 48">And do not obey the rejecters and the hypocrites, and ignore their insults, and put your trust in God; for God suffices as an advocate.</span>
<span class=verse id=s33v49 title="Surah 33, Verse 49">O you who believe, if you marry the believing females, then divorce them before having intercourse with them, then there is no interim required of them. You shall compensate them, and let them go in an amicable manner.</span>
<span class=verse id=s33v50 title="Surah 33, Verse 50">O prophet, We have made lawful for you the wives to whom you have already given their dowries, and those who are maintained by your oath, as granted to you by God; and the daughters of the brothers of your father, and the daughters of the sisters of your father, and the daughters of the brothers of your mother, and the daughters of the sisters of your mother-those who emigrated with you. Also, the believing woman who had decreed herself to the prophet, the prophet may marry her if he wishes, as a privilege given only to you and not to the believers. We have already decreed their rights in regard to their spouses and those who are maintained by their oaths. This is to spare you any hardship. God is Forgiver, Merciful.</span>
<span class=verse id=s33v51 title="Surah 33, Verse 51">You may postpone whom you will of them, and you may receive whom you will. And whomsoever you seek of those whom you have set aside then there is no sin upon you. Such is best that they may be comforted and not grieve, and that they may all be pleased with what you give them. And God knows what is in your hearts. And God is Knowledgeable, Compassionate.</span>
<span class=verse id=s33v52 title="Surah 33, Verse 52">No women are lawful to you beyond this, nor that you change them for other wives, even though you may be attracted by their beauty, except what is maintained by your oath. And God is Watcher over all things.</span>
<span class=verse id=s33v53 title="Surah 33, Verse 53">O you who believe, do not enter the homes of the prophet unless you are invited to a meal, without you forcing such an invitation. But if you are invited, you may enter. And when you finish eating, you shall leave, without staying to wait for a narrative. This used to bother the prophet, and he was shy to tell you. But God does not shy away from the truth. And if you ask his wives for something, ask them from behind a barrier. This is purer for your hearts and their hearts. And it is not for you to harm the messenger of God, nor that you should marry his wives after him. This is indeed a gross offence with God.</span>
<span class=verse id=s33v54 title="Surah 33, Verse 54">If you reveal anything, or hide it, God is fully aware of all things.</span>
<span class=verse id=s33v55 title="Surah 33, Verse 55">There is no sin upon them before their fathers, or their sons, or their brothers, or the sons of their brothers, or the sons of their sisters, or their women, or those who are maintained by their oaths.

<span class=verse id=s33v56 title="Surah 33, Verse 56">God and His angels make contact with the prophet. O you who believe, you shall make contact with him, and comply completely.</span>
<span class=verse id=s33v57 title="Surah 33, Verse 57">Surely those who harm God and His messenger, God will curse them in this world and in the Hereafter; and He has prepared for them a shameful retribution.</span>
<span class=verse id=s33v58 title="Surah 33, Verse 58">And those who harm the believing males and the believing females, with no just reason, they have brought upon themselves a slander and a gross sin.</span>
<span class=verse id=s33v59 title="Surah 33, Verse 59">O prophet, tell your wives, your daughters, and the women of the believers that they should lengthen upon themselves their outer garments. That is better so that they will not be recognized and harmed. God is Forgiver, Merciful.</span>
<span class=verse id=s33v60 title="Surah 33, Verse 60">If the hypocrites and those with disease in their hearts and those who spread lies in the city do not refrain, then We will let you overpower them, then they will not be able to remain as your neighbors except for a short while.</span>
<span class=verse id=s33v61 title="Surah 33, Verse 61">They are cursed wherever they are encountered, and they are taken and killed in numbers.</span>

<span class=verse id=s33v65 title="Surah 33, Verse 65">Abiding therein eternally. They will find no ally, or victor.</span>
<span class=verse id=s33v66 title="Surah 33, Verse 66">On the Day when their faces will be turned over in the Fire, they will say: "Oh, we wish we had obeyed God, and obeyed the messenger"</span>
<span class=verse id=s33v67 title="Surah 33, Verse 67">And they will say: "Our Lord, we have obeyed our leaders and our learned ones, but they misled us from the path."</span>
<span class=verse id=s33v68 title="Surah 33, Verse 68">"Our Lord, give them double the retribution, and curse them with a mighty curse."</span>
<span class=verse id=s33v69 title="Surah 33, Verse 69">O you who believe, do not be like those who harmed Moses, but then God cleared him of all they said, and he was honorable before God.</span>
<span class=verse id=s33v70 title="Surah 33, Verse 70">O you who believe, be aware of God and speak only the truth.</span>
<span class=verse id=s33v71 title="Surah 33, Verse 71">He will then direct your works, and forgive your sins. And whoever obeys God and His messenger has triumphed a great triumph.</span>

<span class=verse id=s33v73 title="Surah 33, Verse 73">So that God may punish the hypocrite males and the hypocrite females, and the polytheist males and the polytheist females. And God redeems the believing males and the believing females. And God is Forgiver, Merciful.</span>

<span class=verse id=s34v2 title="Surah 34, Verse 2">He knows what goes into the earth, and what comes out of it, and what comes down from the heaven, and what ascends into it. He is the Merciful, Forgiver.</span>
<span class=verse id=s34v3 title="Surah 34, Verse 3">And those who rejected said: "The Hour will not come to us!" Say: "Yes, by my Lord, it will come to you." He is the Knower of the unseen; not even the weight of an atom or less than that or greater can be hidden from Him, be it in the heavens or the earth. All are in a clear record.</span>
<span class=verse id=s34v4 title="Surah 34, Verse 4">That He may reward those who believe and do good works. To them will be a forgiveness and a generous provision.</span>
<span class=verse id=s34v5 title="Surah 34, Verse 5">As for those who sought against Our revelations to frustrate them, they will have a retribution of painful affliction.</span>
<span class=verse id=s34v6 title="Surah 34, Verse 6">And those that have been given knowledge will see that what has been sent down to you from your Lord is the truth, and that it guides to the path of the Noble, the Praiseworthy.</span>
<span class=verse id=s34v7 title="Surah 34, Verse 7">And those who rejected said: "Shall we lead you to a man who will tell you that after you are dismembered you will be created anew?"</span>
<span class=verse id=s34v8 title="Surah 34, Verse 8">"Has he invented a lie against God, or is there a madness in him?" Indeed, those who do not believe in the Hereafter will be in a retribution and are far straying.</span>
<span class=verse id=s34v9 title="Surah 34, Verse 9">Have they not seen all that is before them and behind them, in the heaven and the earth? If We wished, We could cause the earth to swallow them, or cause pieces of the heaven to fall on them. In this is a sign for every obedient servant.</span>
<span class=verse id=s34v10 title="Surah 34, Verse 10">And We granted David blessings from Us: "O mountains, echo with him, and the birds." And We softened the iron for him.</span>
<span class=verse id=s34v11 title="Surah 34, Verse 11">That you may make armor coats that fit perfectly, and work righteousness. For I am Seer of what you do.</span>
<span class=verse id=s34v12 title="Surah 34, Verse 12">And for Solomon the wind was given, traveling one month coming and one month going, and We caused a spring of tar to flow for him.

<span class=verse id=s34v13 title="Surah 34, Verse 13">They made for him what he desired of enclosures, and images and pools of deep reservoirs, and heavy pots. "O family of David, work to give thanks." Only a few of My servants are thankful.</span>
<span class=verse id=s34v14 title="Surah 34, Verse 14">Then, when We decreed death for him, nothing informed them of his death until a worm kept eating from his staff, so when he fell down, the Jinn realized that if they had known the unseen, they would not have remained in the humiliating retribution.</span>
<span class=verse id=s34v15 title="Surah 34, Verse 15">There was for Sheba a sign in their homeland, with two gardens on the right and the left. "Eat from the provisions of your Lord, and be thankful to Him." A good land, and a forgiving Lord.</span>
<span class=verse id=s34v16 title="Surah 34, Verse 16">But they turned away, so We sent them a destructive flash flood, and We substituted their two gardens with two gardens of rotten fruits, thorny plants, and a skimpy harvest.</span>

<span class=verse id=s34v18 title="Surah 34, Verse 18">And We placed between them and between the towns that We blessed, towns that were easy to see; and We measured the journey between them: "Travel in them by night and day in complete security."</span>
<span class=verse id=s34v19 title="Surah 34, Verse 19">But they said: "Our Lord, make the measure between our journeys longer," and they wronged themselves. So We made them narrations and We tore them into pieces. In this are signs for every person who is patient, thankful.</span>
<span class=verse id=s34v20 title="Surah 34, Verse 20">And Satan has been successful in his suggestions to them, for they followed him, except for a group of the believers.</span>
<span class=verse id=s34v21 title="Surah 34, Verse 21">And he did not have any authority over them except that We might distinguish those who believed in the Hereafter from those who are doubtful about it. And your Lord is Keeper over all things.</span>
<span class=verse id=s34v22 title="Surah 34, Verse 22">Say: "Call on those whom you have claimed besides God. They do not possess even the weight of an atom in the heavens, or the earth. They possess no partnership therein, nor is there for Him any assistant among them."</span>
<span class=verse id=s34v23 title="Surah 34, Verse 23">"Nor will intercession be of any help with Him, except for whom He has already given leave." Until when the fear has subsided from their hearts, they ask: "What did your Lord say?" They will say: "The truth!" And He is the Most High, the Great.</span>
<span class=verse id=s34v24 title="Surah 34, Verse 24">Say: "Who provides for you from the heavens and the earth?" Say: "God! And either we or you are guided, or are clearly astray."</span>
<span class=verse id=s34v25 title="Surah 34, Verse 25">Say: "You will not be asked about our crimes, nor will we be asked for what you do."</span>
<span class=verse id=s34v26 title="Surah 34, Verse 26">Say: "Our Lord will gather us together then He will judge between us with the truth. He is the Judge, the Knowledgeable."</span>
<span class=verse id=s34v27 title="Surah 34, Verse 27">Say: "Show me those whom you have set up as partners with Him! No; He is but God, the Noble, the Wise."</span>
<span class=verse id=s34v28 title="Surah 34, Verse 28">And We have sent you to all people to be a bearer of good news, and as a warner; but most of the people do not know.</span>
<span class=verse id=s34v29 title="Surah 34, Verse 29">And they say: "When is this promise, if you are truthful?"</span>
<span class=verse id=s34v30 title="Surah 34, Verse 30">Say: "You have an appointed day, which you cannot delay by one hour, nor advance."</span>
<span class=verse id=s34v31 title="Surah 34, Verse 31">And those who rejected have said: "We will not believe in this Qur'an, nor in what is already with him." And if you could but see these transgressors when they stand before their Lord, how they will accuse one another back and forth. Those who were weak will say to those who were mighty: "If it were not for you, we would have been believers!"</span>
<span class=verse id=s34v32 title="Surah 34, Verse 32">Those who were mighty will say to those who were weak: "Did we turn you away from the guidance after it had come to you? No, it was you who were criminals."</span>
<span class=verse id=s34v33 title="Surah 34, Verse 33">And those who were weak will say to those who were mighty: "No, it was your scheming night and day, when you commanded us to reject God and to set up equals to Him." And they are filled with regret when they see the retribution - and We will place shackles around the necks of those who rejected. Are they not being requited for what they used to do?</span>
<span class=verse id=s34v34 title="Surah 34, Verse 34">And We do not send a warner to any town, except its carefree ones would say: "We reject what you have been sent with."</span>
<span class=verse id=s34v35 title="Surah 34, Verse 35">And they said: "We have more wealth and more children, and we will not be punished."</span>
<span class=verse id=s34v36 title="Surah 34, Verse 36">Say: "My Lord gives provisions to whoever He wishes, or He restricts them, but most of the people do not know."</span>
<span class=verse id=s34v37 title="Surah 34, Verse 37">And it is not your money or your children that will bring you closer to Us, but only those who believe and do good work, they will receive double the reward for their works, and they will reside in the high dwellings in peace.</span>
<span class=verse id=s34v38 title="Surah 34, Verse 38">As for those who sought against Our revelations, they will be brought to the retribution.</span>
<span class=verse id=s34v39 title="Surah 34, Verse 39">Say: "My Lord gives provisions for whom He wishes of His servants and He restricts. And anything you spend, He will replace it; and He is the Best of providers."</span>
<span class=verse id=s34v40 title="Surah 34, Verse 40">And on the Day when We gather them all, then We will say to the angels: "Was it you that these people used to serve?"</span>
<span class=verse id=s34v41 title="Surah 34, Verse 41">They will say: "Be You glorified. You are our Lord, not them. No, most of them were serving the Jinn; most were believers to them."</span>
<span class=verse id=s34v42 title="Surah 34, Verse 42">So today, none of you can help or harm one another. And We will say to the transgressors: "Taste the retribution of the Fire that you used to deny."</span>
<span class=verse id=s34v43 title="Surah 34, Verse 43">And when Our clear revelations were recited to them, they said: "This is but a man who wants to turn you away from what your parents were worshiping." And they also said: "This is nothing except a fabricated lie." And those who disbelieved say of the truth when it has come to them: "This is nothing except evident magic!"</span>
<span class=verse id=s34v44 title="Surah 34, Verse 44">We had not given to them any books to study, nor did We send to them before you any warner.</span>
<span class=verse id=s34v45 title="Surah 34, Verse 45">And those before them had also denied, while they did not reach one tenth of what We had given them, but they denied My messengers; so how was My retribution?</span>
<span class=verse id=s34v46 title="Surah 34, Verse 46">Say: "I advise you to do one thing: that you stand to God, in twos and individually, then reflect." There is no madness in your friend, he is only a warner to you in the face of a severe retribution.</span>
<span class=verse id=s34v47 title="Surah 34, Verse 47">Say: "I have not asked you for any wage; for it will be your own. My wage is from God, and He is witness over all things."</span>
<span class=verse id=s34v48 title="Surah 34, Verse 48">Say: "My Lord casts with the truth. He is the Knower of all secrets."</span>
<span class=verse id=s34v49 title="Surah 34, Verse 49">Say: "The truth has come; while falsehood can neither initiate anything, nor resurrect."</span>
<span class=verse id=s34v50 title="Surah 34, Verse 50">Say: "If I stray, then I stray to my own loss. And if I am guided, then it is because of what my Lord inspired to me. He is Hearer, Near."</span>

<span class=verse id=s34v52 title="Surah 34, Verse 52">And they will say: "We believe in it!" But it will be far too late.</span>
<span class=verse id=s34v53 title="Surah 34, Verse 53">And they had rejected it in the past; and they made allegations regarding the unseen, from a place far off.</span>
<span class=verse id=s34v54 title="Surah 34, Verse 54">And a barrier will be set between them and what they had desired, as was done for their counterparts before. They have been in grave doubt.</span>

<span class=verse id=s35v1 title="Surah 35, Verse 1">Praise be to God, Initiator of the heavens and the earth; maker of the angels as messengers with wings of two, and three, and four. He increases in the creation as He wishes. God is able to do all things.</span>
<span class=verse id=s35v2 title="Surah 35, Verse 2">Whatever mercy God opens for the people, none can stop it. And what He holds back none can send it other than He. And He is the Noble, the Wise.</span>
<span class=verse id=s35v3 title="Surah 35, Verse 3">O people, remember the blessings of God upon you. Is there any creator other than God who provides for you from the heaven and the earth? There is no god besides Him, so why do you deviate?</span>
<span class=verse id=s35v4 title="Surah 35, Verse 4">And if they deny you, then also messengers before you have been denied. And to God all matters are returned.</span>
<span class=verse id=s35v5 title="Surah 35, Verse 5">O people, the promise of God is the truth; therefore, do not be overwhelmed by this worldly life, and do not let arrogance overwhelm you from God.</span>
<span class=verse id=s35v6 title="Surah 35, Verse 6">The devil is an enemy to you, so treat him as an enemy. He only invites his faction to be the dwellers of Hell.</span>
<span class=verse id=s35v7 title="Surah 35, Verse 7">Those who reject will have a painful retribution, and those who believe and do good works they will have a forgiveness and a great reward.</span>
<span class=verse id=s35v8 title="Surah 35, Verse 8">As for he whose evil work is adorned for him so he sees it as being good; for God thus misguides whom He wills, and He guides whom He wills. So do not let yourself grieve over them. God is fully aware of what they are doing.</span>
<span class=verse id=s35v9 title="Surah 35, Verse 9">And God is the One who sends the winds so it stirs up a cloud, then We drive it to a land that is dead, and We revive with it the earth after it had died. Such is the resurrection.</span>
<span class=verse id=s35v10 title="Surah 35, Verse 10">Whoever is seeking dignity, then know that to God belongs all dignity. To Him ascend the good words, and the good deeds raise them up. And as for those who scheme evil, they will have a painful retribution, and their scheming will fail.</span>
<span class=verse id=s35v11 title="Surah 35, Verse 11">And God created you from dust, then from a seed, then He made you into pairs. And no female becomes pregnant, nor gives birth, without His knowledge. Nor does anyone have his life extended, or his life is shortened, except in a record. This is easy for God.</span>
<span class=verse id=s35v12 title="Surah 35, Verse 12">Nor are the two seas the same. One is fresh and palatable, good to drink, while the other is salty and bitter. And from each of them you eat tender meat, and you extract jewelry to wear. And you see the ships sailing through them, seeking His provisions; and perhaps you may be thankful.</span>
<span class=verse id=s35v13 title="Surah 35, Verse 13">He merges the night into the day, and He merges the day into the night. And He has commissioned the sun and the moon, each running for an appointed term. Such is God your Lord; to Him is the sovereignty. And as for those whom you pray to besides Him, they do not possess even the shell of a seed.</span>
<span class=verse id=s35v14 title="Surah 35, Verse 14">If you pray to them, they cannot hear you. And even if they hear you, they cannot respond to you. And on the Day of Resurrection, they will reject your partnership. And none can inform you like an Expert.</span>

<span class=verse id=s35v18 title="Surah 35, Verse 18">And none can carry the load of another; and even if it calls on another to bear part of its load, no other can carry any part of it, even if they were related. You will only be able to warn those who are concerned towards their Lord while unseen, and they hold the contact prayer. And whoever contributes, is contributing for himself. And to God is the final destiny.</span>
<span class=verse id=s35v19 title="Surah 35, Verse 19">The blind and the seer are not equal.</span>
<span class=verse id=s35v20 title="Surah 35, Verse 20">Nor are the darkness and the light.</span>
<span class=verse id=s35v21 title="Surah 35, Verse 21">Nor are the shade and the heat.</span>
<span class=verse id=s35v22 title="Surah 35, Verse 22">Nor equal are the living and the dead; God causes whoever He wills to hear; and you cannot make those who are in the graves hear.</span>
<span class=verse id=s35v23 title="Surah 35, Verse 23">You are but a warner.</span>
<span class=verse id=s35v24 title="Surah 35, Verse 24">We have sent you with the truth as a bearer of good news and a warner. There was not a nation that a warner did not come to it.</span>
<span class=verse id=s35v25 title="Surah 35, Verse 25">And if they deny you, then those before them have also denied. Their messengers went to them with the proofs and the scriptures and the Book of Enlightenment.</span>
<span class=verse id=s35v26 title="Surah 35, Verse 26">Then I seized those who rejected; so how was My retribution!</span>
<span class=verse id=s35v27 title="Surah 35, Verse 27">Do you not see that God sends down water from the sky, thus We produce with it fruits of various colors? And of the mountains are peaks that are white, red, or some other color and intense black.</span>
<span class=verse id=s35v28 title="Surah 35, Verse 28">And from the people, and the animals, and the livestock, are various colors. Those concerned with God from among His servants are the most knowledgeable. God is Noble, Forgiving.</span>
<span class=verse id=s35v29 title="Surah 35, Verse 29">Surely, those who recite the Book of God and hold the contact prayer, and spend secretly and openly from what We have provided them, they are seeking a trade that can never lose.</span>
<span class=verse id=s35v30 title="Surah 35, Verse 30">He will give them their recompense, and He will increase them from His blessings. He is Forgiving, Thankful.</span>
<span class=verse id=s35v31 title="Surah 35, Verse 31">And what We inspired to you from the Book, it is the truth, authenticating what is between his hands. God is Expert over His servants, Seer.</span>
<span class=verse id=s35v32 title="Surah 35, Verse 32">Then We inherited the Book to those whom We selected from Our servants. Subsequently, some of them wronged themselves, and others upheld it partly, while others were eager to work righteousness in accordance with the will of God; such is the great benefit.</span>
<span class=verse id=s35v33 title="Surah 35, Verse 33">They will enter gardens of delight, where they will be adorned with bracelets of gold and pearls, and their garments in it will be of silk.</span>
<span class=verse id=s35v34 title="Surah 35, Verse 34">And they will say: "Praise be to God who took away our sorrow. Our Lord is Forgiving, Thankful."</span>
<span class=verse id=s35v35 title="Surah 35, Verse 35">"The One who admitted us into the abode of eternal bliss, out of His grace. In it, no boredom touches us, nor does any fatigue."</span>
<span class=verse id=s35v36 title="Surah 35, Verse 36">As for those who have rejected, for them is the fire of Hell, where they do not terminate and die, nor is its retribution ever reduced for them. It is such that We requite every rejecter.</span>
<span class=verse id=s35v37 title="Surah 35, Verse 37">And they will scream in it: "Our Lord, let us out, and we will work righteousness instead of the works we used to do." Did We not give you a long life so that he who would remember would take heed, and a warner came to you? Therefore, taste, for the transgressors will have no supporter.</span>
<span class=verse id=s35v38 title="Surah 35, Verse 38">God knows the unseen of the heavens and the earth. He is knowledgeable of what is even in the chests.</span>
<span class=verse id=s35v39 title="Surah 35, Verse 39">He is the One who made you successors on the earth. So, whoever rejects, then to him is his rejection. And the rejection of the rejecters only increases the abhorrence of their Lord towards them. The rejection of the rejecters only increases their loss.</span>
<span class=verse id=s35v40 title="Surah 35, Verse 40">Say: "Do you see the partners whom you have called on besides God? Show me what they have created on the earth. Or do they possess any partnership in the heavens? Or have We given them a book wherein they are taking knowledge from it? Indeed, what the transgressors promise one another is no more than arrogance."</span>
<span class=verse id=s35v41 title="Surah 35, Verse 41">God is the One who holds the heavens and the earth, lest they cease to exist. And they would certainly cease to exist if anyone else were to hold them after Him. He is Compassionate, Forgiving.</span>
<span class=verse id=s35v42 title="Surah 35, Verse 42">And they swore by God in their strongest oaths, that if a warner came to them, they would be the most guided of all nations, but when a warner came to them, it only increased their aversion!</span>
<span class=verse id=s35v43 title="Surah 35, Verse 43">Arrogance on the earth, and evil scheming. And the evil schemes only backfire on those who scheme them. Were they expecting anything different from the ways used on the people of the past? You will not find any change in the way of God, and you will not find any bypass to the way of God.</span>
<span class=verse id=s35v44 title="Surah 35, Verse 44">Did they not roam the earth and note how was the consequence for those who were before them? And they were even more powerful than they in strength. But nothing can inhibit God be it in the heavens, or the earth. He is Knowledgeable, Omnipotent.</span>
<span class=verse id=s35v45 title="Surah 35, Verse 45">And if God were to punish the people for what they have earned, He would not leave a single creature standing. But He delays them to an appointed term. So, when their time comes, then God is Seer of His servants.</span>

<span class=verse id=s36v4 title="Surah 36, Verse 4">Upon a straight path.</span>
<span class=verse id=s36v5 title="Surah 36, Verse 5">The revelation of the Most Honorable, the Merciful.</span>
<span class=verse id=s36v6 title="Surah 36, Verse 6">To warn a people whose fathers were not warned, for they are unaware.</span>
<span class=verse id=s36v7 title="Surah 36, Verse 7">The retribution has been deserved by most of them, for they do not believe.</span>
<span class=verse id=s36v8 title="Surah 36, Verse 8">We have placed shackles around their necks, up to their chins, so that they are forced in place.</span>
<span class=verse id=s36v9 title="Surah 36, Verse 9">And We have placed a barrier in front of them, and a barrier behind them, thus We shielded them so they cannot see.</span>
<span class=verse id=s36v10 title="Surah 36, Verse 10">And whether you warn them or do not warn them, they will not believe.</span>
<span class=verse id=s36v11 title="Surah 36, Verse 11">You can only warn him who follows the Reminder, and is concerned towards the Almighty while unseen. Give him good news of forgiveness and a generous reward.</span>
<span class=verse id=s36v12 title="Surah 36, Verse 12">It is indeed Us who resurrect the dead, and We record what they have done and left behind. And everything We have counted in a clear guide.</span>
<span class=verse id=s36v13 title="Surah 36, Verse 13">And put forth for them the example of the people of the town, when the messengers came to it.</span>
<span class=verse id=s36v14 title="Surah 36, Verse 14">Where We sent two to them, but they disbelieved in them, so We supported them with a third one, thus they said: "We are messengers to you."</span>
<span class=verse id=s36v15 title="Surah 36, Verse 15">They said: "You are but mortals like us, and the Almighty did not send down anything, you are only telling lies."</span>
<span class=verse id=s36v16 title="Surah 36, Verse 16">They said: "Our Lord knows that we have been sent to you."</span>
<span class=verse id=s36v17 title="Surah 36, Verse 17">"And we are only required to give a clear delivery."</span>
<span class=verse id=s36v18 title="Surah 36, Verse 18">They said: "We have welcomed you better than you deserve. If you do not cease, we will stone you, and you will receive a painful retribution from us!"</span>

<span class=verse id=s36v20 title="Surah 36, Verse 20">And a man came running from the farthest part of the city, saying: "O my people, follow the messengers."</span>
<span class=verse id=s36v21 title="Surah 36, Verse 21">"Follow those who do not ask you for any wage, and are guided."</span>
<span class=verse id=s36v22 title="Surah 36, Verse 22">"And why should I not serve the One who initiated me, and to Him is your ultimate return?"</span>

<span class=verse id=s36v26 title="Surah 36, Verse 26">It was said: "Enter Paradise." He said "Oh, how I wish if only my people knew!"</span>
<span class=verse id=s36v27 title="Surah 36, Verse 27">"Of what my Lord has forgiven me, and made me of the honored ones."</span>
<span class=verse id=s36v28 title="Surah 36, Verse 28">And We did not send down upon his people after him soldiers from the heaven; for there was no need to send them down.</span>
<span class=verse id=s36v29 title="Surah 36, Verse 29">For all it took was one scream, whereupon they were stilled.</span>
<span class=verse id=s36v30 title="Surah 36, Verse 30">What sorrow for the servants. For every time a messenger went to them, they would mock him.</span>
<span class=verse id=s36v31 title="Surah 36, Verse 31">Did they not see how many generations We destroyed before them, do they not go back to them?</span>
<span class=verse id=s36v32 title="Surah 36, Verse 32">And how every one of them will be summoned before Us.</span>
<span class=verse id=s36v33 title="Surah 36, Verse 33">And a sign for them is the dead land, We revive it and produce from it seeds from which they eat.</span>
<span class=verse id=s36v34 title="Surah 36, Verse 34">And We made in it gardens of date palms, and grapes, and We cause springs to gush forth therein.</span>
<span class=verse id=s36v35 title="Surah 36, Verse 35">So that they may eat from its fruits, and what they manufacture with their own hands. Would they be thankful?</span>
<span class=verse id=s36v36 title="Surah 36, Verse 36">Praise be to the One who has created all pairs from what the earth sprouts out and from themselves, and from what they do not know.</span>
<span class=verse id=s36v37 title="Surah 36, Verse 37">And a sign for them is the night, We strip the daylight from it, whereupon they are in darkness.</span>
<span class=verse id=s36v38 title="Surah 36, Verse 38">And the sun runs to a specific destination, such is the design of the Noble, the Knowledgeable.</span>
<span class=verse id=s36v39 title="Surah 36, Verse 39">And the moon We have measured it to appear in stages, until it returns like an old palm sheath.</span>
<span class=verse id=s36v40 title="Surah 36, Verse 40">The sun is not required to overtake the moon, nor will the night precede the day; each of them is swimming in its own orbit.</span>
<span class=verse id=s36v41 title="Surah 36, Verse 41">And a sign for them is that We carried their ancestors on the charged ship.</span>
<span class=verse id=s36v42 title="Surah 36, Verse 42">And We created for them of its similarity, to ride in.</span>
<span class=verse id=s36v43 title="Surah 36, Verse 43">And if We wished, We could drown them, so that their screaming would not be heard, nor could they be saved.</span>
<span class=verse id=s36v44 title="Surah 36, Verse 44">Except through a mercy from Us, and as an enjoyment for awhile.</span>
<span class=verse id=s36v45 title="Surah 36, Verse 45">And when they are told: "Be aware of your present and your past, that you may attain mercy."</span>
<span class=verse id=s36v46 title="Surah 36, Verse 46">And no matter what sign comes to them from the signs of their Lord, they turn away from it.</span>
<span class=verse id=s36v47 title="Surah 36, Verse 47">And when they are told: "Spend from what God has provisioned you." Those who reject say to those who believe: "Shall we feed those whom God could feed, if He so willed? You are clearly misguided!"</span>
<span class=verse id=s36v48 title="Surah 36, Verse 48">And they say: "When is this promise to come, if you are truthful?"</span>
<span class=verse id=s36v49 title="Surah 36, Verse 49">They will not realize it when one scream overwhelms them, while they dispute.</span>
<span class=verse id=s36v50 title="Surah 36, Verse 50">They will not even be able to leave a will, nor will they be able to return to their people.</span>
<span class=verse id=s36v51 title="Surah 36, Verse 51">And the horn will be blown, whereupon they will rise from the graves massing towards their Lord.</span>
<span class=verse id=s36v52 title="Surah 36, Verse 52">They will say: "Woe to us! Who has resurrected us from our resting place? This is what the Almighty had promised; and the messengers were truthful!"</span>
<span class=verse id=s36v53 title="Surah 36, Verse 53">It only took one scream, whereupon they are summoned before Us.</span>
<span class=verse id=s36v54 title="Surah 36, Verse 54">On this Day, no soul will be wronged in the least. You will be recompensed precisely for whatever you did.</span>
<span class=verse id=s36v55 title="Surah 36, Verse 55">The dwellers of Paradise will be, on that Day, joyfully busy.</span>
<span class=verse id=s36v56 title="Surah 36, Verse 56">Both them and their spouses, they will be shaded, reclining on raised couches.</span>
<span class=verse id=s36v57 title="Surah 36, Verse 57">They will have fruits therein; they will have in it whatever they ask for.</span>
<span class=verse id=s36v58 title="Surah 36, Verse 58">Saying of: "Peace" from a Merciful Lord.</span>
<span class=verse id=s36v59 title="Surah 36, Verse 59">"As for you, O criminals, you are singled out."</span>
<span class=verse id=s36v60 title="Surah 36, Verse 60">"Did I not pledge to you, O Children of Adam, that you should not serve the devil for he is your most ardent enemy?"</span>
<span class=verse id=s36v61 title="Surah 36, Verse 61">"And that you should serve Me? That is a straight path."</span>
<span class=verse id=s36v62 title="Surah 36, Verse 62">"He has misled mountain loads of you. Did you not comprehend?"</span>
<span class=verse id=s36v63 title="Surah 36, Verse 63">"This is Hell that you have been promised!"</span>
<span class=verse id=s36v64 title="Surah 36, Verse 64">"Burn in it today, as a consequence of your rejection."</span>
<span class=verse id=s36v65 title="Surah 36, Verse 65">Today, We shall cease their mouths, and their hands will speak to Us, and their feet will bear witness to everything they had done.</span>
<span class=verse id=s36v66 title="Surah 36, Verse 66">And if We wished, We can blind their eyes, and they would race towards the path, but how would they see?</span>
<span class=verse id=s36v67 title="Surah 36, Verse 67">And if We wished, We can freeze them in their place; thus, they can neither move forward, nor go back.</span>
<span class=verse id=s36v68 title="Surah 36, Verse 68">And for whoever We grant a long life, We weaken him in body. Do they not comprehend?</span>
<span class=verse id=s36v69 title="Surah 36, Verse 69">And We did not teach him poetry, nor does he need it. This is a reminder and a clear Qur'an.</span>
<span class=verse id=s36v70 title="Surah 36, Verse 70">To warn those who are alive, and so that the retribution will be deserved by the rejecters.</span>
<span class=verse id=s36v71 title="Surah 36, Verse 71">Did they not see that We created for them with Our own hands livestock which they own?</span>
<span class=verse id=s36v72 title="Surah 36, Verse 72">And they were subdued by Us for them. So some they ride, and some they eat.</span>
<span class=verse id=s36v73 title="Surah 36, Verse 73">And they have benefits in them, and to drink. Would they not be thankful?</span>
<span class=verse id=s36v74 title="Surah 36, Verse 74">And they have taken besides God other gods, perhaps they will help them!</span>
<span class=verse id=s36v75 title="Surah 36, Verse 75">They cannot help them; while they are soldiers for them.</span>
<span class=verse id=s36v76 title="Surah 36, Verse 76">So do not be saddened by what they say. We are fully   aware of what they conceal and what they declare.</span>
<span class=verse id=s36v77 title="Surah 36, Verse 77">Has the human being not seen that We have created him from a seed, but he then becomes a clear opponent?</span>
<span class=verse id=s36v78 title="Surah 36, Verse 78">And he puts forth an example for Us, while forgetting his own creation! He says: "Who can resurrect the bones while they are dust?"</span>
<span class=verse id=s36v79 title="Surah 36, Verse 79">Say: "The One who has made them in the first place will resurrect them. He is fully aware of every creation."</span>
<span class=verse id=s36v80 title="Surah 36, Verse 80">The One who initiated for you a forest fire, by which you learned to light.</span>
<span class=verse id=s36v81 title="Surah 36, Verse 81">Is not the One who has created the heavens and the earth able to create the like of them? Yes indeed; He is the Creator, the Knowledgeable.</span>
<span class=verse id=s36v82 title="Surah 36, Verse 82">His command, when He wants anything, is to say to it: 'Be,' and it is.</span>
<span class=verse id=s36v83 title="Surah 36, Verse 83">Therefore, praise be to the One in whose Hand is the sovereignty of all things, and to Him you will be returned.</span>

<span class=verse id=s37v71 title="Surah 37, Verse 71">Most of the previous generations have strayed before them.</span>
<span class=verse id=s37v72 title="Surah 37, Verse 72">And We had sent to them warners.</span>
<span class=verse id=s37v73 title="Surah 37, Verse 73">Thus note the consequences for those who were warned.</span>

<span class=verse id=s39v0 title="Surah 39, Verse 0"><em>In the name of God, the Almighty, the Merciful.</em></span>
<span class=verse id=s39v1 title="Surah 39, Verse 1">The sending down of the Book is from God, the Noble, the Wise.</span>
<span class=verse id=s39v2 title="Surah 39, Verse 2">We have sent down to you the Book with the truth, so serve God while devoting the system to Him.</span>
<span class=verse id=s39v3 title="Surah 39, Verse 3">Absolutely, to God is the true system. And those who set up allies besides Him: "We only serve them so that they may bring us closer to God." God will judge between them in what they dispute. For God does not guide him who is a liar, a rejecter.</span>
<span class=verse id=s39v4 title="Surah 39, Verse 4">If God wished to take a son, He could have exalted from among His creation what He pleases. Be He glorified; He is God, the One, the Supreme.</span>
<span class=verse id=s39v5 title="Surah 39, Verse 5">He created the heavens and the earth with the truth. He rolls the night over the day, and He rolls the day over the night. And He commissioned the sun and the moon, each running for an appointed term. Absolutely, He is the Noble, the Forgiving.</span>
<span class=verse id=s39v6 title="Surah 39, Verse 6">He created you from one person, then He made from it its mate. And He sent down to you eight pairs of the livestock. He creates you in the wombs of your mothers, a creation after a creation in three darkness's. Such is God your Lord. To Him belongs the sovereignty. There is no god besides Him. How is it then you deviate?</span>
<span class=verse id=s39v7 title="Surah 39, Verse 7">If you reject, then know that God is in no need of you, and He is displeased with rejection for His servants. And if you are thankful, He is pleased with it for you. And none shall carry the burdens of another. Then to your Lord is your return, and He will inform you of everything you had done. He is fully aware of what is in the chests.</span>
<span class=verse id=s39v8 title="Surah 39, Verse 8">And when the human being is afflicted with adversity, he implores his Lord, turning in repentance to Him. But then, when He grants him a blessing from Him, he forgets his previous imploring, and sets up equals with God, in order to mislead others from His path. Say: "Enjoy your rejection for a while; for you are of the dwellers of the Fire."</span>
<span class=verse id=s39v9 title="Surah 39, Verse 9">Is one better who is devout during the night, prostrating and standing, fearing the Hereafter, and seeking the mercy of his Lord? Say: "Are those who know equal to those who do not know?" Only those who possess intelligence will remember.</span>
<span class=verse id=s39v10 title="Surah 39, Verse 10">Say: "O My servants who believed, be aware of your Lord." For those who worked righteousness in this world will be a good reward, and the earth of God is spacious. Those who steadfastly persevere will receive their recompense fully, without reckoning.</span>
<span class=verse id=s39v11 title="Surah 39, Verse 11">Say: "I have been commanded to serve God, devoting the system to Him."</span>
<span class=verse id=s39v12 title="Surah 39, Verse 12">"And I was commanded to be the first of those who submit."</span>
<span class=verse id=s39v13 title="Surah 39, Verse 13">Say: "I fear, if I disobeyed my Lord, the retribution of a great Day."</span>
<span class=verse id=s39v14 title="Surah 39, Verse 14">Say: "God is the One I serve, devoting my system to Him."</span>
<span class=verse id=s39v15 title="Surah 39, Verse 15">"Therefore, serve whatever you wish besides Him." Say: "The losers are those who lose their souls, and their families, on the Day of Resurrection. Indeed, such is the real loss."</span>
<span class=verse id=s39v16 title="Surah 39, Verse 16">They will have coverings of fire from above them and below them. It is as such that God makes His servants fearful: "O My servants, you shall reverence Me."</span>
<span class=verse id=s39v17 title="Surah 39, Verse 17">And for those who avoid serving evil, and turn to God in repentance, for them are glad tidings. So give the good news to My servants.</span>
<span class=verse id=s39v18 title="Surah 39, Verse 18">The ones who listen to what is being said, and then follow the best of it. These are the ones whom God has guided, and these are the ones who possess intelligence.</span>
<span class=verse id=s39v19 title="Surah 39, Verse 19">As for those who have deserved the retribution; can you save those who are in the Fire?</span>
<span class=verse id=s39v20 title="Surah 39, Verse 20">But those who reverence their Lord, they will have dwellings constructed upon dwellings, with rivers flowing beneath them. The promise of God, and God does not break the promise.</span>
<span class=verse id=s39v21 title="Surah 39, Verse 21">Do you not see that God sends down water from the sky, then lets it run as springs in the earth, then He produces with it plants of various colors, then they grow until they turn yellow, then He makes them dry and broken? In this is a reminder for those who possess intelligence.</span>
<span class=verse id=s39v22 title="Surah 39, Verse 22">If God comforts the chest of a person to submission, then he will be on a light from his Lord. So woe to those whose hearts are hardened against remembering God. They have gone far astray.</span>
<span class=verse id=s39v23 title="Surah 39, Verse 23">God has sent down the best narrative, a Book that is similar, dual. The skins of those who are concerned towards their Lord shiver from it, then their skins and their hearts soften up to the remembrance of God. Such is the guidance of God; He guides with it whoever He wills. And for whoever God misguides, then none can guide him.</span>
<span class=verse id=s39v24 title="Surah 39, Verse 24">As he who saves his face from the terrible retribution on the Day of Resurrection. And it will be said to the transgressors: "Taste for what you have earned."</span>
<span class=verse id=s39v25 title="Surah 39, Verse 25">Those before them have denied, and thus the retribution came to them from where they did not perceive.</span>
<span class=verse id=s39v26 title="Surah 39, Verse 26">So God made them taste the humiliation in this worldly life, but the retribution in the Hereafter is far greater, if only they knew.</span>
<span class=verse id=s39v27 title="Surah 39, Verse 27">And We have put forth for the people in this Qur'an from every example, that they may take heed.</span>
<span class=verse id=s39v28 title="Surah 39, Verse 28">A revelation in Arabic, without any crookedness, that they may be righteous.</span>
<span class=verse id=s39v29 title="Surah 39, Verse 29">God puts forth the example of a man who has partners that dispute with each other, and a man who has given to dealing with only one man. Are they the same? Praise be to God; most of them do not know.</span>
<span class=verse id=s39v30 title="Surah 39, Verse 30">You will die, and they will die.</span>
<span class=verse id=s39v31 title="Surah 39, Verse 31">Then, on the Day of Resurrection, you will quarrel at your Lord.</span>
<span class=verse id=s39v32 title="Surah 39, Verse 32">Who is more wicked than he who lies about God, and denies the truth when it comes to him? Is there not in Hell an abode for the rejecters?</span>
<span class=verse id=s39v33 title="Surah 39, Verse 33">And those who came with the truth, and believed in it, these are the righteous.</span>
<span class=verse id=s39v34 title="Surah 39, Verse 34">They shall have what they wish at their Lord. Such is the reward for the good doers.</span>
<span class=verse id=s39v35 title="Surah 39, Verse 35">So that God may cancel for them the worst that they did, and He may recompense them their reward for the best of what they used to do.</span>
<span class=verse id=s39v36 title="Surah 39, Verse 36">Is God not enough for His servant? And they frighten you with others besides Him. And whoever God sends astray, then for him there will be no guide.</span>
<span class=verse id=s39v37 title="Surah 39, Verse 37">And whoever God guides, then there will be none that can mislead him. Is God not Noble, with Vengeance?</span>
<span class=verse id=s39v38 title="Surah 39, Verse 38">And if you ask them: "Who has created the heavens and the earth?" They will say: "God." Say: "Do you see what you call on besides God, If God wanted any harm for me, can they alleviate His harm? Or if He wanted a mercy for me, can they hold back his mercy?" Say: "God is sufficient for me; in Him those who trust shall place their trust."</span>
<span class=verse id=s39v39 title="Surah 39, Verse 39">Say: "O my people, work according to your way, and I will work. You will come to know."</span>
<span class=verse id=s39v40 title="Surah 39, Verse 40">"To whom the humiliating retribution will come, and on whom a permanent retribution will be cast."</span>
<span class=verse id=s39v41 title="Surah 39, Verse 41">We have sent down to you the Book for the people with the truth. Then, whoever is guided is guided for himself, and whoever goes astray goes astray to his own loss. And you are not a keeper over them.</span>
<span class=verse id=s39v42 title="Surah 39, Verse 42">God seizes the souls at the time of their death; and for those that have not died, during their sleep. He then keeps those that have been overtaken by death, and He sends the others back until a predetermined time. In that are signs for a people who will think.</span>
<span class=verse id=s39v43 title="Surah 39, Verse 43">Or have they taken intercessors besides God? Say: "What if they possessed nothing, nor comprehended?"</span>
<span class=verse id=s39v44 title="Surah 39, Verse 44">Say: "To God belongs all intercession." To Him belongs the sovereignty of the heavens and the earth, then to Him you will be returned.</span>
<span class=verse id=s39v45 title="Surah 39, Verse 45">And when God alone is mentioned, the hearts of those who do not believe in the Hereafter are filled with aversion; and when others are mentioned besides Him, they rejoice!</span>
<span class=verse id=s39v46 title="Surah 39, Verse 46">Say: "Our god, Initiator of the heavens and the earth, Knower of the unseen and the seen, You will judge between Your servants regarding what they disputed in."</span>
<span class=verse id=s39v47 title="Surah 39, Verse 47">And if those who transgressed owned everything on the earth, and its equivalent again with it, they would ransom it to avoid the terrible retribution on the Day of Resurrection. They will be shown by God what they did not expect.</span>
<span class=verse id=s39v48 title="Surah 39, Verse 48">And the sinful works they had earned will be shown to them, and they will be surrounded by that which they used to mock.</span>
<span class=verse id=s39v49 title="Surah 39, Verse 49">So when the human being is touched by adversity, he implores Us, then when We bestow a blessing upon him, he says: "I attained this because of knowledge I had!" Indeed, it is a test, but most of them do not know.</span>
<span class=verse id=s39v50 title="Surah 39, Verse 50">Those before them have said the same thing, yet what they earned did not help them in the least.</span>
<span class=verse id=s39v51 title="Surah 39, Verse 51">So, they suffered the evil of what they had earned. And those who transgressed from among these here will suffer the evil of what they earned; they cannot escape.</span>
<span class=verse id=s39v52 title="Surah 39, Verse 52">Do they not realize that God spreads the provision for whoever He chooses, and withholds? In that are signs for a people who believe.</span>
<span class=verse id=s39v53 title="Surah 39, Verse 53">Say: "O My servants who transgressed against themselves, do not despair of the mercy of God. For God forgives all sins. He is the Forgiver, the Merciful."</span>
<span class=verse id=s39v54 title="Surah 39, Verse 54">And repent to your Lord, and submit to Him, before the retribution comes to you. Then you cannot be helped.</span>
<span class=verse id=s39v55 title="Surah 39, Verse 55">And follow the best of what has been sent down to you from your Lord, before the retribution comes to you suddenly when you least expect it.</span>
<span class=verse id=s39v56 title="Surah 39, Verse 56">Lest a soul will say: "How sorry I am for disregarding the path of God; and I was certainly one of those who mocked."</span>
<span class=verse id=s39v57 title="Surah 39, Verse 57">Or say: "Had God guided me, I would have been among the righteous."</span>
<span class=verse id=s39v58 title="Surah 39, Verse 58">Or say, when it sees the retribution: "If only I could have another chance, I would be among the good doers."</span>
<span class=verse id=s39v59 title="Surah 39, Verse 59">Yes indeed, My revelations came to you, but you denied them and turned arrogant, and became one of the rejecters.</span>
<span class=verse id=s39v60 title="Surah 39, Verse 60">And on the Day of Resurrection you will see those who lied about God, their faces will be darkened. Is there not an abode in Hell for the arrogant ones?</span>
<span class=verse id=s39v61 title="Surah 39, Verse 61">And God will save those who were righteous as their reward. No harm will touch them, nor will they grieve.</span>
<span class=verse id=s39v62 title="Surah 39, Verse 62">God is the Creator of all things, and He is Guardian over all things.</span>
<span class=verse id=s39v63 title="Surah 39, Verse 63">To Him belongs the keys of the heavens and the earth. And those who rejected the revelations God, they are the losers.</span>
<span class=verse id=s39v64 title="Surah 39, Verse 64">Say: "Do you order me to serve other than God, O you ignorant ones?"</span>
<span class=verse id=s39v65 title="Surah 39, Verse 65">And He has inspired to you and to those before you, that if you set up partners, He will nullify all your works, and you will be of the losers.</span>
<span class=verse id=s39v66 title="Surah 39, Verse 66">Therefore, you shall serve God, and be among the thankful.</span>
<span class=verse id=s39v67 title="Surah 39, Verse 67">And they have not given God His true worth; and the whole earth is within His fist on the Day of Resurrection, and the heavens will be folded in His right hand. Be He glorified and exalted above what they set up.</span>
<span class=verse id=s39v68 title="Surah 39, Verse 68">And the horn will be blown, whereupon everyone in the heavens and the earth will be struck unconscious, except those spared by God. Then it will be blown another time, whereupon they will all rise up, looking.</span>
<span class=verse id=s39v69 title="Surah 39, Verse 69">And the earth will shine with the light of its Lord, and the record will be placed, and the prophets and the witnesses will be brought forth; and it will then be judged between them with the truth, and they will not be wronged.</span>
<span class=verse id=s39v70 title="Surah 39, Verse 70">And every soul will be paid for whatever it did, for He is fully aware of everything they have done.</span>
<span class=verse id=s39v71 title="Surah 39, Verse 71">And those who rejected will be driven to Hell in groups. When they reach it, and its gates are opened, its guards will say to them: "Did you not receive messengers from among you who recited to you the revelations of your Lord, and warned you about meeting this Day?" They said: "Yes indeed; but the sentence of retribution has come to pass upon the rejecters."</span>
<span class=verse id=s39v72 title="Surah 39, Verse 72">It was said: "Enter the gates of Hell, abiding therein. What a miserable destiny for the arrogant."</span>
<span class=verse id=s39v73 title="Surah 39, Verse 73">And those who reverenced their Lord will be driven to Paradise in groups. When they reach it, and its gates are opened, its guards will say to them: "Peace be upon you. You have done well, so enter to abide herein."</span>
<span class=verse id=s39v74 title="Surah 39, Verse 74">And they said: "Praise be to God who has fulfilled His promise to us, and He made us inherit the land, enjoying Paradise as we please. What a beautiful recompense for the workers!"</span>
<span class=verse id=s39v75 title="Surah 39, Verse 75">And you will see the angels surrounding the Throne, glorifying the praise of their Lord. And it will be judged between them with the truth, and it will be said: "Praise be to God, Lord of the worlds"</span>

<span class=verse id=s40v2 title="Surah 40, Verse 2">The revelation of the Book is from God, the Noble, the Knowledgeable.</span>
<span class=verse id=s40v3 title="Surah 40, Verse 3">Forgiver of sins, and accepter of repentance, severe in retribution, with ability to reach. There is no god other than Him, to Him is the ultimate destiny.</span>
<span class=verse id=s40v4 title="Surah 40, Verse 4">None dispute in the revelations of God except those who have rejected. So do not be impressed by their influence in the land.</span>
<span class=verse id=s40v5 title="Surah 40, Verse 5">Denial had come before them from the people of Noah, and the Confederates after them. And every nation obsessed with their messenger-to take him-and they disputed by means of falsehood to defeat with it the truth. So I took them; how then was My punishment!</span>
<span class=verse id=s40v6 title="Surah 40, Verse 6">And as such, the word of your Lord has come to pass upon those who rejected, that they are the dwellers of the Fire.</span>
<span class=verse id=s40v7 title="Surah 40, Verse 7">Those who carry the Throne and all those surrounding it glorify the praise of their Lord, and believe in Him, and they seek forgiveness for those who have believed: "Our Lord, You encompass all things with mercy and knowledge, so forgive those who repented and followed Your path, and spare them the agony of Hell."</span>
<span class=verse id=s40v8 title="Surah 40, Verse 8">"Our Lord, and admit them into gardens of delight which You had promised for them and for those who did good of their fathers, their spouses, and their progeny. You are the Noble, the Wise."</span>
<span class=verse id=s40v9 title="Surah 40, Verse 9">"And save them from the sins. And whoever You save from the sins, on that Day, You have granted him mercy. And such is the great triumph."</span>
<span class=verse id=s40v10 title="Surah 40, Verse 10">Those who had rejected will be told: "The abhorrence of God towards you is greater than your abhorrence of yourselves, for you were invited to believe, but you chose to reject."</span>
<span class=verse id=s40v11 title="Surah 40, Verse 11">They will say: "Our Lord, You have made us die twice, and You have given us life twice. Now we have confessed our sins. Is there any way out of this state?"</span>
<span class=verse id=s40v12 title="Surah 40, Verse 12">This is because when God alone was mentioned, you rejected, but when partners were set up with Him, you believed. Therefore, the judgment is for God, the Most High, the Great.</span>
<span class=verse id=s40v13 title="Surah 40, Verse 13">He is the One who shows you His signs, and He sends down to you provisions from the heaven. But none do remember except those who repent.</span>
<span class=verse id=s40v14 title="Surah 40, Verse 14">Therefore, call on God while being pure to His system, even if the rejecters hate it.</span>
<span class=verse id=s40v15 title="Surah 40, Verse 15">Possessor of the highest ranks, the One with the Throne. He sends the Spirit with His command upon whom He wills from His servants, that they may warn of the Day of Summoning.</span>
<span class=verse id=s40v16 title="Surah 40, Verse 16">The Day when they will be exposed. None of them will hide anything from God. To whom is the sovereignty on this Day? To God, the One, the Supreme.</span>
<span class=verse id=s40v17 title="Surah 40, Verse 17">Today, every soul will be recompensed for what it had earned. There will be no injustice today. Truly, God is swift in reckoning.</span>
<span class=verse id=s40v18 title="Surah 40, Verse 18">And warn them of the imminent Day, when the hearts will reach the throats, and many will be remorseful. The transgressors will have no friend nor intercessor to be obeyed.</span>

<span class=verse id=s40v20 title="Surah 40, Verse 20">And God judges with the truth, while those they call on besides Him do not judge with anything. Certainly, God is the Hearer, the Seer.</span>
<span class=verse id=s40v21 title="Surah 40, Verse 21">Have they not roamed the earth and seen how was the consequence of those who were before them? They used to be stronger than they, and had built more in the land. But God seized them for their sins, and they had no protector against God.</span>
<span class=verse id=s40v22 title="Surah 40, Verse 22">That is because their messengers used to come to them with proofs, but they rejected. Thus God seized them; for He is Mighty, severe in punishment.</span>
<span class=verse id=s40v23 title="Surah 40, Verse 23">And We had sent Moses with Our signs, and a clear authority.</span>
<span class=verse id=s40v24 title="Surah 40, Verse 24">To Pharaoh, Haamaan, and Qaroon. But they said: "A lying magician!"</span>
<span class=verse id=s40v25 title="Surah 40, Verse 25">Then, when the truth came to them from Us, they said: "Kill the children of those who believed with him, and rape their women." But the planning of the rejecters is always in error.</span>
<span class=verse id=s40v26 title="Surah 40, Verse 26">And Pharaoh said: "Leave me to kill Moses, and let him call upon his Lord. I fear that he may change your system, or that he will cause evil to spread throughout the land."</span>
<span class=verse id=s40v27 title="Surah 40, Verse 27">And Moses said: "I seek refuge with my Lord and your Lord from every arrogant one who does not believe in the Day of Reckoning"</span>
<span class=verse id=s40v28 title="Surah 40, Verse 28">And a believing man from among the people of Pharaoh, who had concealed his belief, said: "Will you kill a man simply for saying: 'My Lord is God', and he has come to you with proofs from your Lord? And if he is a liar, then his lie will be upon him, and if he is truthful, then some of what he is promising you will afflict you. For God does not guide any transgressor, liar."</span>
<span class=verse id=s40v29 title="Surah 40, Verse 29">"O my people, you have the kingship today throughout the land. But then who will save us against the torment of God, should it come to us?" Pharaoh said: "I am showing you that which I see, and I am guiding you in the right path."</span>
<span class=verse id=s40v30 title="Surah 40, Verse 30">And the one who believed said: "O my people, I fear for you the same fate as the day of the Confederates."</span>
<span class=verse id=s40v31 title="Surah 40, Verse 31">"Like the fate of the people of Noah, 'Aad, and Thamud, and those after them. And God does not wish any injustice for the servants."</span>

<span class=verse id=s40v33 title="Surah 40, Verse 33">"A Day when you will turn around and flee, you will have no protector besides God, and whoever God sends astray, then there is none who can guide him."</span>
<span class=verse id=s40v34 title="Surah 40, Verse 34">"And Joseph had come to you before with proofs, but you remained in doubt regarding what he came to you with, until when he died, you said: "God will not send any messenger after him." It is such that God sends astray he who is a transgressor, doubter."</span>
<span class=verse id=s40v35 title="Surah 40, Verse 35">Those who dispute about the revelations of God without any authority that has come to them, it is greatly abhorred with God and with those who believe. God thus seals the hearts of every arrogant tyrant.</span>
<span class=verse id=s40v36 title="Surah 40, Verse 36">And Pharaoh said: "O Haamaan, build for me a high platform that I may uncover the secrets."</span>
<span class=verse id=s40v37 title="Surah 40, Verse 37">"The secrets of the heavens, so that I may take a look at the god of Moses; though I think he is a liar." Thus the evil works of Pharaoh were adorned for him, and he was blocked from the path. And the planning of Pharaoh brought nothing but regret.</span>
<span class=verse id=s40v38 title="Surah 40, Verse 38">And the one who believed said: "O my people, follow me, and I will guide you to the right path."</span>
<span class=verse id=s40v39 title="Surah 40, Verse 39">"O my people, this worldly life is but an enjoyment, while the Hereafter is the permanent abode."</span>
<span class=verse id=s40v40 title="Surah 40, Verse 40">"Whoever does a sin, will not be requited except for its equivalent, and whoever does good, whether male or female, and is a believer, then those will be admitted to Paradise, where they will receive provision without reckoning."</span>
<span class=verse id=s40v41 title="Surah 40, Verse 41">"And, O my people, why is it that I invite you to salvation, while you invite me to the Fire!"</span>
<span class=verse id=s40v42 title="Surah 40, Verse 42">"You invite me to reject God, and set up partners besides Him that I have no knowledge of, and I am inviting you to the Noble, the Forgiver."</span>
<span class=verse id=s40v43 title="Surah 40, Verse 43">"There is no doubt that what you invite me to has no basis in this world, nor in the Hereafter. And our ultimate return will be to God, and that the transgressors will be the dwellers of the Fire."</span>

<span class=verse id=s40v45 title="Surah 40, Verse 45">So God protected him from the evil of what they schemed, while the people of Pharaoh have incurred the worst retribution.</span>
<span class=verse id=s40v46 title="Surah 40, Verse 46">The Fire, which they will be exposed to morning and evening, and on the Day when the Hour is established: "Admit the people of Pharaoh into the most severe of the retribution."</span>

<span class=verse id=s40v52 title="Surah 40, Verse 52">A Day when excuses will be of no help to the transgressors, and they will be cursed, and they will have the worst abode.</span>

<span class=verse id=s40v56 title="Surah 40, Verse 56">Surely, those who dispute about the revelations of God without any authority given to them, there is nothing except arrogance in their chests, which they do not perceive. Therefore, seek refuge with God; He is the Hearer, the Seer.</span>
<span class=verse id=s40v57 title="Surah 40, Verse 57">The creation of the heavens and the earth is greater than the creation of the people, but most of the people do not know.</span>
<span class=verse id=s40v58 title="Surah 40, Verse 58">And not equal are the blind and the seer, nor those who believe and do good works, and those who do evil. Little do you remember.</span>
<span class=verse id=s40v59 title="Surah 40, Verse 59">Surely the Hour is coming, there is no doubt in it, but most of the people do not believe.</span>
<span class=verse id=s40v60 title="Surah 40, Verse 60">And your Lord said: "Call on Me and I will respond to you." Surely, those who are too arrogant to serve Me, they will enter Hell, humbled.</span>
<span class=verse id=s40v61 title="Surah 40, Verse 61">God, it is He Who has made for you the night to reside in and the day to see in. Surely, God provides many blessings upon the people, but most of the people are not thankful.</span>
<span class=verse id=s40v62 title="Surah 40, Verse 62">That is God, your Lord, Creator of all things. There is no god except He, so why do you deviate?</span>
<span class=verse id=s40v63 title="Surah 40, Verse 63">Thus, those who were denying the revelations of God were deviated.</span>
<span class=verse id=s40v64 title="Surah 40, Verse 64">God is the One who made the earth a habitat for you, and the heaven as a structure, and He designed you, and has perfected your design. And He provided you with good provisions. Such is God your Lord. Most Exalted is God, Lord of the worlds.</span>
<span class=verse id=s40v65 title="Surah 40, Verse 65">He is the Living; there is no god except He. So call on Him while devoting the system to Him. Praise be to God, Lord of the worlds.</span>
<span class=verse id=s40v66 title="Surah 40, Verse 66">Say: "I have been prohibited from serving those whom you are calling upon besides God, since the proofs have come to me from my Lord. And I have been commanded to submit to the Lord of the worlds."</span>
<span class=verse id=s40v67 title="Surah 40, Verse 67">He is the One who has created you from dust, then from a seed, then from an embryo, then He brings you out as a child, then He lets you reach your maturity, then you become old; and some of you will have their lives terminated before this; and that you may reach an appointed term, and perhaps so you may comprehend.</span>
<span class=verse id=s40v68 title="Surah 40, Verse 68">He is the One who gives life and death. And when He decides upon anything, He simply says to it: 'Be,' and it is.</span>
<span class=verse id=s40v69 title="Surah 40, Verse 69">Did you not note those who dispute about the revelations of God, how they have deviated?</span>
<span class=verse id=s40v70 title="Surah 40, Verse 70">Those who deny the Book, and what We have sent Our messengers with. Therefore, they will come to know.</span>
<span class=verse id=s40v71 title="Surah 40, Verse 71">When the shackles will be around their necks and in chains they will be dragged off.</span>

<span class=verse id=s40v73 title="Surah 40, Verse 73">Then it will be said to them: "Where are those that you have set up as partners"</span>
<span class=verse id=s40v74 title="Surah 40, Verse 74">"Beside God?" They will say: "They have abandoned us. No, we did not used to call on anything before!" Thus God leads the rejecters astray.</span>
<span class=verse id=s40v75 title="Surah 40, Verse 75">That was because you used to gloat on the earth without any right, and for what you used to rejoice.</span>
<span class=verse id=s40v76 title="Surah 40, Verse 76">Enter the gates of Hell, abiding therein. What a miserable abode for the arrogant ones.</span>
<span class=verse id=s40v77 title="Surah 40, Verse 77">So be patient, for the promise of God is true. So, if We show you some of what We promise them, or We terminate your life, then it is to Us that they will be returned.</span>
<span class=verse id=s40v78 title="Surah 40, Verse 78">And We have sent messengers prior to you. Some of them We have told to you, and some We did not tell to you. And it was not given to any messenger that he should bring a sign except with the permission of God. So, when the judgment of God is issued, the matter is decided with the truth, and the followers of falsehood will be lost.</span>
<span class=verse id=s40v79 title="Surah 40, Verse 79">God is the One who made the livestock for you that you may ride on some of them, and some of them you eat.</span>

<span class=verse id=s40v82 title="Surah 40, Verse 82">Have they not roamed the earth and noted the consequences for those who were before them? They used to be greater in number than them and mightier in strength, and they had built more in the land. Yet, all that they had earned could not avail them.</span>
<span class=verse id=s40v83 title="Surah 40, Verse 83">Then, when their messengers came to them with clear proofs, they were content with what they already had of knowledge. And they will be surrounded by that which they used to mock.</span>
<span class=verse id=s40v84 title="Surah 40, Verse 84">So when they saw Our might, they said: "We believe in God alone, and we reject all the partners we used to set up!"</span>
<span class=verse id=s40v85 title="Surah 40, Verse 85">But their belief could not help them once they saw Our might; such is the way of God that has been established for His servants; and the rejecters were then totally in loss.</span>

<span class=verse id=s41v2 title="Surah 41, Verse 2">A revelation from the Almighty, the Merciful.</span>
<span class=verse id=s41v3 title="Surah 41, Verse 3">A Book whose verses are made detailed-an Arabic revelation for a people who know.</span>
<span class=verse id=s41v4 title="Surah 41, Verse 4">A bearer of good news, and a warner. But most of them turn away; they do not hear.</span>
<span class=verse id=s41v5 title="Surah 41, Verse 5">And they said: "Our hearts are sealed from what you invite us to, and in our ears is a deafness, and there is a barrier between us and you. So do what you will, and so will we."</span>
<span class=verse id=s41v6 title="Surah 41, Verse 6">Say: "I am no more than a mortal like you. It is inspired to me that your god is One god, therefore you shall be upright towards Him and seek His forgiveness. And woe to the polytheists."</span>
<span class=verse id=s41v7 title="Surah 41, Verse 7">"The ones who do not contribute towards purification, and with regards to the Hereafter, they are disbelievers."</span>
<span class=verse id=s41v8 title="Surah 41, Verse 8">Surely, those who believe and do good works, they will receive recompense that will not end.</span>
<span class=verse id=s41v9 title="Surah 41, Verse 9">Say: "You are rejecting the One who has created the earth in two days, and you set up equals with Him. That is the Lord of the worlds."</span>
<span class=verse id=s41v10 title="Surah 41, Verse 10">And He placed in it stabilizers from above it, and He blessed it and established its provisions in proportion in four days, to satisfy those who ask.</span>
<span class=verse id=s41v11 title="Surah 41, Verse 11">Then He settled to the heaven, while it was still smoke, and He said to it, and to the earth: "Come willingly or unwillingly." They said: "We come willingly."</span>
<span class=verse id=s41v12 title="Surah 41, Verse 12">Thus, He then made them into seven heavens in two days, and He inspired to every heaven its affair. And We adorned the lowest heaven with lamps, and for protection. Such is the design of the Noble, the Knowledgeable.</span>
<span class=verse id=s41v13 title="Surah 41, Verse 13">But if they turn away, then say: "I have warned you of a destruction like the destruction of 'Aad and Thamud."</span>
<span class=verse id=s41v14 title="Surah 41, Verse 14">When the messengers came to them, publicly and privately: "You shall not serve except God." They said: "Had our Lord willed, He would have sent angels. We are rejecting what you have been sent with."</span>
<span class=verse id=s41v15 title="Surah 41, Verse 15">As for 'Aad, they turned arrogant on the earth, without any right, and they said: "Who is mightier than us in strength?" Did they not see that God, who has created them, was mightier than they in strength? And they were denying Our revelations.</span>
<span class=verse id=s41v16 title="Surah 41, Verse 16">Consequently, We sent upon them a violent wind, for a few miserable days, that We may let them taste the humiliating retribution in this worldly life, and the retribution of the Hereafter is more humiliating; they can never win.</span>
<span class=verse id=s41v17 title="Surah 41, Verse 17">And as for Thamud, We gave them the guidance, but they preferred blindness over guidance. Consequently, the blast of humiliating retribution annihilated them, because of what they earned.</span>
<span class=verse id=s41v18 title="Surah 41, Verse 18">And We saved those who believed and were righteous.</span>
<span class=verse id=s41v19 title="Surah 41, Verse 19">And the Day when the enemies of God will be gathered to the Fire, forcibly.</span>
<span class=verse id=s41v20 title="Surah 41, Verse 20">When they come to it, their own hearing, eyes, and skins will bear witness to everything they had done.</span>
<span class=verse id=s41v21 title="Surah 41, Verse 21">And they will say to their skins: "Why did you bear witness against us?" They will say: "God made us speak; He is the One who causes everything to speak. He is the One who has created you the first time, and to Him you return."</span>
<span class=verse id=s41v22 title="Surah 41, Verse 22">And there was no way you could hide from the testimony of your own hearing, or your eyes, or your skins. In fact, you thought that God was unaware of much of what you do.</span>
<span class=verse id=s41v23 title="Surah 41, Verse 23">And this is the kind of thinking about your Lord that has caused you to fail, and thus you became of the losers.</span>
<span class=verse id=s41v24 title="Surah 41, Verse 24">If they wait, then the Fire will be their destiny, and if they beg to be excused, they will not be excused.</span>
<span class=verse id=s41v25 title="Surah 41, Verse 25">And We assigned to them associates who adorned their present and past actions. Thus, the retribution has been deserved by them the same as previous nations of Jinn and mankind; all of them were losers.</span>
<span class=verse id=s41v26 title="Surah 41, Verse 26">And those who rejected said: "Do not listen to this Qur'an and make noise over it that you may succeed."</span>
<span class=verse id=s41v27 title="Surah 41, Verse 27">We will let those who have rejected taste a severe retribution. And We will recompense them for the evil that they used to do.</span>
<span class=verse id=s41v28 title="Surah 41, Verse 28">Such is the recompense for the enemies of God. The Fire shall be their eternal abode, as a recompense for their discarding Our revelations.</span>
<span class=verse id=s41v29 title="Surah 41, Verse 29">And those who have rejected will say: "Our Lord, show us those who have misled us from among the Jinn and mankind so we can trample them under our feet, so that they would be the lowest."</span>
<span class=verse id=s41v30 title="Surah 41, Verse 30">Those who have said: "Our Lord is God," then they did right, the angels will come down upon them: "You shall not fear, nor shall you grieve. Rejoice in the good news of Paradise that you have been promised."</span>
<span class=verse id=s41v31 title="Surah 41, Verse 31">"We are your allies in this worldly life and in the Hereafter. In it you will have anything your soul desires, and in it you will have anything you ask for."</span>
<span class=verse id=s41v32 title="Surah 41, Verse 32">"A dwelling, from a Forgiver, Merciful."</span>
<span class=verse id=s41v33 title="Surah 41, Verse 33">And who is better in saying than he who invites to God, and does good works, and says: "I am one of those who have submitted."</span>
<span class=verse id=s41v34 title="Surah 41, Verse 34">Not equal are the good and the bad response. You shall resort to the one which is better. Thus, the one who used to be your enemy, may become your best friend.</span>
<span class=verse id=s41v35 title="Surah 41, Verse 35">And none can attain this except those who are patient. And none can attain this except those who are extremely fortunate.</span>
<span class=verse id=s41v36 title="Surah 41, Verse 36">And if bitterness from the devil afflicts you, then seek refuge with God. He is the Hearer, the Knowledgeable.</span>
<span class=verse id=s41v37 title="Surah 41, Verse 37">And from among His signs are the night and the day, and the sun and the moon. Do not prostrate to the sun, nor the moon; you shall prostrate to God who has created them, if it is truly Him you serve.</span>
<span class=verse id=s41v38 title="Surah 41, Verse 38">So, if they become arrogant, then those who are with your Lord glorify Him night and day, and they never despair.</span>
<span class=verse id=s41v39 title="Surah 41, Verse 39">And from among His signs is that you see the land still, then, as soon as We send down the water upon it, it shakes and grows. Surely, the One who revived it can revive the dead. He is capable of all things.</span>
<span class=verse id=s41v40 title="Surah 41, Verse 40">Those who distort Our revelations are not hidden from Us. Is one who is thrown into Hell better, or one who comes secure on the Day of Resurrection? Do whatever you wish; He is Seer of what you do.</span>
<span class=verse id=s41v41 title="Surah 41, Verse 41">Those who have rejected the Reminder when it came to them; and it is an Honorable Book.</span>
<span class=verse id=s41v42 title="Surah 41, Verse 42">No falsehood could enter it, presently or afterwards; a revelation from One Most Wise, Praiseworthy.</span>
<span class=verse id=s41v43 title="Surah 41, Verse 43">What is being said to you is the same that was said to the messengers before you. Your Lord has forgiveness, and He has a painful retribution.</span>
<span class=verse id=s41v44 title="Surah 41, Verse 44">And had We made it a non-Arabic revelation, they would have said: "If only its verses were made clear!" Non-Arabic and Arabic, say: "For those who believe, it is a guide and healing. As for those who disbelieve, there is deafness in their ears, and they are blind to it. These will be called from a place far away."</span>
<span class=verse id=s41v45 title="Surah 41, Verse 45">And We have given Moses the Book, but it was disputed in. And had it not been for the predetermined decision of your Lord, they would have been judged immediately. Indeed, they harbor many doubts about it.</span>
<span class=verse id=s41v46 title="Surah 41, Verse 46">Whoever does good works does so for his own soul, and whoever works evil shall have the same. Your Lord does not wrong the servants.</span>
<span class=verse id=s41v47 title="Surah 41, Verse 47">To Him belongs the knowledge regarding the Hour. And no fruit emerges from its sheath, nor does any female conceive or give birth, except by His knowledge. And on the Day He asks them: "Where are My partners?" They will say: "With your permission, none of us will bear witness to such!"</span>
<span class=verse id=s41v48 title="Surah 41, Verse 48">And they were abandoned by that which they used to call on before, and they realized that there will be no escape.</span>
<span class=verse id=s41v49 title="Surah 41, Verse 49">The human being does not tire in praying for good things. But if adversity touches him, he is disheartened, desperate!</span>
<span class=verse id=s41v50 title="Surah 41, Verse 50">And when We let him taste a mercy from Us after hardship had touched him, he will say: "This was by my actions, and I do not think that the Hour will come to pass. And even if I am returned to my Lord, I will find at Him good things for me." Surely, We will inform the rejecters of all they had done, and We will let them taste the severe retribution.</span>
<span class=verse id=s41v51 title="Surah 41, Verse 51">And when We bless man, he withdraws and turns away, and when he suffers any adversity, then he implores at length!</span>
<span class=verse id=s41v52 title="Surah 41, Verse 52">Say: "Do you see if this was from God and then you rejected it? Who is further astray than those who are in opposition?"</span>
<span class=verse id=s41v53 title="Surah 41, Verse 53">We will show them Our signs in the horizons, and within themselves, until it becomes clear to them that this is the truth. Is it not enough that your Lord is witness over all things?</span>
<span class=verse id=s41v54 title="Surah 41, Verse 54">Indeed, they are in doubt about meeting their Lord; but He is encompassing all things.</span>

<span class=verse id=s42v7 title="Surah 42, Verse 7">And thus We have inspired to you an Arabic revelation, so that you may warn the capital town and all around it, and to warn about the Day of Gathering that is inevitable. A group will be in Paradise, and a group in Hell.</span>
<span class=verse id=s42v8 title="Surah 42, Verse 8">And if God had willed, He could have made them one nation. But He admits whom He wills into His mercy. And the transgressors will have neither an ally, nor helper.</span>

<span class=verse id=s45v6 title="Surah 45, Verse 6">These are the revelations of God, We recite them to you with the truth. So, in which narrative after God and His revelations do they believe?</span>
<span class=verse id=s45v7 title="Surah 45, Verse 7">Woe to every sinful fabricator.</span>
<span class=verse id=s45v8 title="Surah 45, Verse 8">He hears the revelations of God being recited to him, then he persists arrogantly, as if he never heard them. Give him news of a painful retribution.</span>
<span class=verse id=s45v9 title="Surah 45, Verse 9">And if he learns anything from Our revelations, he takes it in mockery. For these will be a humiliating retribution.</span>
<span class=verse id=s45v10 title="Surah 45, Verse 10">Waiting for them is Hell. And that which they earned will not help them, nor those whom they have taken as allies besides God, and for them is a terrible retribution.</span>
<span class=verse id=s45v11 title="Surah 45, Verse 11">This is a guidance. And those who reject the revelations of their Lord, for them is an affliction of a painful retribution.</span>
<span class=verse id=s45v12 title="Surah 45, Verse 12">God is the One who commissioned the sea in your service, so that the ships can run in it by His command, and that you may seek of His provisions, and that you may be thankful.</span>

<span class=verse id=s45v14 title="Surah 45, Verse 14">Say to those who believed to forgive those who do not look forward to the days of God. He will recompense a people for whatever they have earned.</span>
<span class=verse id=s45v15 title="Surah 45, Verse 15">Whoever works good does so for himself, and whoever works evil will suffer it. Then to your Lord you will be returned.</span>
<span class=verse id=s45v16 title="Surah 45, Verse 16">And We had given the Children of Israel the Book, and the judgment, and the prophethood, and We provided them with good provisions; and We preferred them over the worlds.</span>

<span class=verse id=s45v22 title="Surah 45, Verse 22">And God created the heavens and the earth with the truth, and so that every soul may be recompensed for whatever it earned, and they will not be wronged.</span>
<span class=verse id=s45v23 title="Surah 45, Verse 23">Have you seen the one who took his desire as his god, and God led him astray, despite his knowledge, and He sealed his hearing and his heart, and He made a veil on his eyes? Who then can guide him after God? Will you not remember?</span>
<span class=verse id=s45v24 title="Surah 45, Verse 24">And they said: "There is nothing except this worldly life; we die and we live and nothing destroys us except the passing of time!" And they have no knowledge about this; they only conjecture.</span>
<span class=verse id=s45v25 title="Surah 45, Verse 25">And when Our clear revelations are recited to them, their only argument is to say: "Then bring back our forefathers, if you are truthful."</span>
<span class=verse id=s45v26 title="Surah 45, Verse 26">Say: "God gives you life, then He puts you to death, then He will gather you to the Day of Resurrection, in which there is no doubt. But most of the people do not know."</span>

<span class=verse id=s45v30 title="Surah 45, Verse 30">As for those who believed and did good works, their Lord will admit them into His mercy. Such is the clear triumph.</span>
<span class=verse id=s45v31 title="Surah 45, Verse 31">As for those who disbelieve: "Were not My revelations recited to you, but you turned arrogant and were a criminal people?"</span>
<span class=verse id=s45v32 title="Surah 45, Verse 32">And when it was said: "Surely the promise of God is the truth, and there is no doubt about the coming of the Hour," you said: "We do not know what the Hour is! We are full of conjecture about it; we are not certain."</span>
<span class=verse id=s45v33 title="Surah 45, Verse 33">And the evils of their works will become evident to them, and they will be surrounded by that which they used to mock.</span>
<span class=verse id=s45v34 title="Surah 45, Verse 34">And it will be said to them: "Today We will forget you, just as you forgot the meeting of this Day. And your abode is the Fire, and you will have no helpers."</span>
<span class=verse id=s45v35 title="Surah 45, Verse 35">"This is because you took the revelations of God in mockery, and you were deceived by the worldly life." So from this Day, they will never exit therefrom, nor will they be excused.</span>
<span class=verse id=s45v36 title="Surah 45, Verse 36">To God belongs all praise; the Lord of the heavens, and the Lord of the earth; the Lord of the worlds.</span>

<span class=verse id=s46v5 title="Surah 46, Verse 5">And who is more astray than he who calls on others besides God that do not respond to him even until the Day of Resurrection? And they are totally unaware of the calls to them!</span>
<span class=verse id=s46v6 title="Surah 46, Verse 6">And at the time when the people are gathered, they will be enemies for them, and they will reject their worship.</span>
<span class=verse id=s46v7 title="Surah 46, Verse 7">And when Our clear revelations are recited to them, those who rejected said of the truth that came to them: "This is evidently magic!"</span>
<span class=verse id=s46v8 title="Surah 46, Verse 8">Or do they say: "He fabricated this!" Say: "If I fabricated this, then you cannot protect me at all from God. He is fully aware of what you say. He suffices as a witness between me and you. He is the Forgiver, the Merciful."</span>
<span class=verse id=s46v9 title="Surah 46, Verse 9">Say: "I am no different from the other messengers, nor do I know what will happen to me or to you. I only follow what is inspired to me. I am no more than a clear warner"</span>
<span class=verse id=s46v10 title="Surah 46, Verse 10">Say: "Do you see that if it were from God, and you rejected it, and a witness from the Children of Israel bore witness to its similarity, and he has believed, while you have turned arrogant? Surely, God does not guide the wicked people."</span>

<span class=verse id=s46v12 title="Surah 46, Verse 12">And before it was the Book of Moses, a beacon and a mercy. And this is an authenticating Book, in an Arabic tongue, so that you may warn those who have transgressed, and to give good news to the righteous.</span>

And let my progeny be righteous. I have repented to You; I am of those who have submitted."</span>
<span class=verse id=s46v16 title="Surah 46, Verse 16">It is from these that We accept the best of their deeds, and We shall overlook their sins, among the dwellers of Paradise. This is the promise of truth that they had been promised.</span>

Are you promising me that I will be resurrected, when the generations who died before me never came back?" While they both will implore God: "Woe to you; believe! For the promise of God is the truth." He would say: "This is nothing except fictional tales of old!"</span>
<span class=verse id=s46v18 title="Surah 46, Verse 18">These are the ones against whom the retribution has been deserved in nations who had come before them of mankind and Jinn; they are the losers.</span>
<span class=verse id=s46v19 title="Surah 46, Verse 19">And to each will be degrees according to what they did, and He will recompense them and they will not be wronged.</span>
<span class=verse id=s46v20 title="Surah 46, Verse 20">And on the Day when those who disbelieved will be displayed to the Fire: "You have wasted the good things given to you during your worldly life, and you took pleasure in it.

No, this is what you had asked to be hastened; a violent wind wherein there is a painful retribution.</span>
<span class=verse id=s46v25 title="Surah 46, Verse 25">It destroys everything by the command of its Lord. Thus they became such that nothing could be seen except their dwellings. We thus requite the criminal people.</span>
<span class=verse id=s46v26 title="Surah 46, Verse 26">And We had established them in the same way as We established you, and provided them with hearing, and eyesight, and hearts. But their hearing, eyesight, and hearts did not help them at all. This is because they used to disregard the revelations of God, and they will be surrounded by that which they used to mock.</span>
<span class=verse id=s46v27 title="Surah 46, Verse 27">And We destroyed the towns around you and We had dispatched the signs, perhaps they would repent.</span>
<span class=verse id=s46v28 title="Surah 46, Verse 28">They were to be supported by those who had established offerings to gods instead of God. Alas, they abandoned them. Such was their lie, and what they fabricated.</span>
<span class=verse id=s46v29 title="Surah 46, Verse 29">And We directed to you a company of Jinn, in order to let them listen to the Qur'an. So when they arrived there, they said: "Pay attention." Then, when it was finished, they returned to their people, to warn them.</span>
<span class=verse id=s46v30 title="Surah 46, Verse 30">They said: "O our people, we have heard a Book that was sent down after Moses, authenticating what is between his hands. It guides to the truth; and to a straight path."</span>
<span class=verse id=s46v31 title="Surah 46, Verse 31">"O our people, respond to the caller to God, and believe in Him. He will then forgive your sins, and spare you a painful retribution."</span>

<span class=verse id=s46v34 title="Surah 46, Verse 34">And the Day those who rejected are displayed to the Fire: "Is this not the truth?" They will say: "Yes indeed, by our Lord." He will say, "Then taste the retribution for what you had rejected."</span>
<span class=verse id=s46v35 title="Surah 46, Verse 35">Therefore, be patient like the messengers of strong-will did before you and do not be in haste regarding them. On the Day they will see what they have been promised, it will be as if they had not remained except for one hour of a single day. A proclamation: "Are any destroyed except for the wicked people?"</span>

<span class=verse id=s47v2 title="Surah 47, Verse 2">And those who believe and do good works, and believe in what was sent down to Mohammed, for it is the truth from their Lord, He cancels for them their sins, and relieves their concern.</span>
<span class=verse id=s47v3 title="Surah 47, Verse 3">That is because those who reject followed falsehood, while those who believe followed the truth from their Lord. God thus puts forth for the people their examples.</span>
<span class=verse id=s47v4 title="Surah 47, Verse 4">Therefore, if you encounter those who have rejected, then strike the necks; until you bind them, then secure the cords. You may then either set them free or ransom them, until the war ends. That, and if God had willed, He alone could have beaten them, but He thus tests you by one another. As for those who get killed in the cause of God, He will never let their deeds be put to waste.</span>
<span class=verse id=s47v5 title="Surah 47, Verse 5">He will guide them, and relieve their concerns.</span>
<span class=verse id=s47v6 title="Surah 47, Verse 6">And He will admit them into Paradise, which He has described to them.</span>

<span class=verse id=s47v9 title="Surah 47, Verse 9">That is because they hated what God sent down, thus He nullifies their works.</span>
<span class=verse id=s47v10 title="Surah 47, Verse 10">Did they not roam the earth and note how was the end for those before them? God destroyed them; and for the rejecters in a similar fate.</span>
<span class=verse id=s47v11 title="Surah 47, Verse 11">This is because God is the Master for those who believe, while the rejecters have no master.</span>
<span class=verse id=s47v12 title="Surah 47, Verse 12">God admits those who believe and do good works to gardens with rivers flowing beneath them. As for those who reject, they are enjoying and eating as the livestock eat, and the Fire will be their abode.</span>
<span class=verse id=s47v13 title="Surah 47, Verse 13">And many a town was stronger than your own town, which drove you out. We destroyed them, and there was none who could help them.</span>
<span class=verse id=s47v14 title="Surah 47, Verse 14">Is he who is based on proof from his Lord, as he for whom his evil works have been adorned for him and they followed their desires?</span>
<span class=verse id=s47v15 title="Surah 47, Verse 15">Is the example of Paradise; that the righteous have been promised with rivers of pure water, and rivers of milk whose taste does not change, and rivers of intoxicants that are delicious for the drinkers, and rivers of strained honey, and for them in it are all kinds of fruits, and a forgiveness from their Lord; like that of those who abide in the Fire, and are given to drink boiling water that cuts-up their intestines?</span>
<span class=verse id=s47v16 title="Surah 47, Verse 16">And some of them listen to you, until when they go out from you, they say to those who have been given the knowledge: "What did he say?" Those are the ones whom God has sealed their hearts, and they followed their desires.</span>
<span class=verse id=s47v17 title="Surah 47, Verse 17">And those who are guided, He increases their guidance, and grants them their righteousness.</span>
<span class=verse id=s47v18 title="Surah 47, Verse 18">So are they waiting until the Hour comes to them suddenly? For its conditions have already been met. But once it comes to them, how will they benefit from their message?</span>
<span class=verse id=s47v19 title="Surah 47, Verse 19">So know that there is no god besides God, and ask forgiveness of your sins and also for the believing males and the believing females. And God knows your movements and your place of rest.</span>
<span class=verse id=s47v20 title="Surah 47, Verse 20">And those who believe say: "If only a Chapter is sent down!" But when a lawgiving Chapter is sent down, and fighting is mentioned in it, you see those who have a disease in their hearts look at you, as if death had already come to them. It thus revealed them.</span>
<span class=verse id=s47v21 title="Surah 47, Verse 21">Obedience and to speak righteousness until the matter is decided, then if they trust God it would be better for them.</span>
<span class=verse id=s47v22 title="Surah 47, Verse 22">So do you plan that when you turn away, that you will corrupt the land and sever your family ties?</span>
<span class=verse id=s47v23 title="Surah 47, Verse 23">These are the ones whom God has cursed and thus He made them deaf and blinded their sight.</span>
<span class=verse id=s47v24 title="Surah 47, Verse 24">Do they not reflect upon the Qur'an? Or are there locks on the hearts?</span>
<span class=verse id=s47v25 title="Surah 47, Verse 25">Surely, those who returned back, after the guidance has been made clear to them, the devil has enticed them and has led them on.</span>
<span class=verse id=s47v26 title="Surah 47, Verse 26">That is because they said to those who hated what God had sent down: "We will obey you in certain matters." And God knows their secrets.</span>
<span class=verse id=s47v27 title="Surah 47, Verse 27">So how will it be when their lives are terminated by the angels, while striking their faces and their backs?</span>
<span class=verse id=s47v28 title="Surah 47, Verse 28">That is because they followed that which angered God, and they hated that which pleased Him. Thus, He nullified their works.</span>
<span class=verse id=s47v29 title="Surah 47, Verse 29">Or did those who harbor a disease in their hearts think that God would not bring out their evil thoughts?</span>
<span class=verse id=s47v30 title="Surah 47, Verse 30">And if We wished, We would show them to you so you would recognize them by their looks. However, you can recognize them by their speech. And God is fully aware of your works.</span>
<span class=verse id=s47v31 title="Surah 47, Verse 31">And We will test you for We know those who strive among you and those who are patient. And We will bring out your qualities.</span>
<span class=verse id=s47v32 title="Surah 47, Verse 32">Those who have rejected and repelled from the path of God, and stood against the messenger; after the guidance has been made clear for them; they will not harm God in the least, and He will nullify their works.</span>
<span class=verse id=s47v33 title="Surah 47, Verse 33">O you who believe, obey God, and obey the messenger. And do not render your works in vain.</span>
<span class=verse id=s47v34 title="Surah 47, Verse 34">Surely, those who rejected and repelled from the path of God, then they died while still rejecting, God will never forgive them.</span>
<span class=verse id=s47v35 title="Surah 47, Verse 35">Therefore, do not be weak and ask for peace, for you are on a higher moral ground, and God is with you. And He will not waste your efforts.</span>
<span class=verse id=s47v36 title="Surah 47, Verse 36">The worldly life is no more than play and distraction. But if you believe and lead a righteous life, He will reward you, and He will not ask you for your wealth.</span>
<span class=verse id=s47v37 title="Surah 47, Verse 37">If He were to ask you for it, to the extent of creating a hardship for you, you would become stingy, and your hidden evil will be exposed.</span>
<span class=verse id=s47v38 title="Surah 47, Verse 38">Here you are being invited to spend in the cause of God, but some among you turn stingy. And whoever is stingy is only being stingy on himself. And God is the Rich, while you are the poor. And if you turn away, He will substitute another people instead of you, then they will not be like you.</span>

<span class=verse id=s48v1 title="Surah 48, Verse 1">We have given you a clear conquest.</span>
<span class=verse id=s48v2 title="Surah 48, Verse 2">That God may forgive your present sins, and those past, and so that He may complete His blessings upon you, and guide you on a straight path.</span>
<span class=verse id=s48v3 title="Surah 48, Verse 3">And God will support you with a victory which is noble.</span>
<span class=verse id=s48v4 title="Surah 48, Verse 4">He is the One who sends down tranquility into the hearts of the believers, so that they may increase in faith along with their present faith. And to God belong the soldiers of the heavens and the earth, and God is Knowledgeable, Wise.</span>
<span class=verse id=s48v5 title="Surah 48, Verse 5">That He may admit the believing males and believing females into gardens with rivers flowing beneath them, abiding therein, and He will forgive their sins for them. And with God this is a great triumph.</span>
<span class=verse id=s48v6 title="Surah 48, Verse 6">And He will punish the hypocrite males and the hypocrite females, and the polytheist males and the polytheist females; they think evil thoughts about God. Their evil will come back to them, and God was angry with them, and He has cursed them and prepared for them Hell. What a miserable destiny!</span>
<span class=verse id=s48v7 title="Surah 48, Verse 7">And to God belong the soldiers of the heavens and the earth. And God is Noble, Wise.</span>
<span class=verse id=s48v8 title="Surah 48, Verse 8">We have sent you as a witness, a bearer of good news, and a warner.</span>
<span class=verse id=s48v9 title="Surah 48, Verse 9">That you may believe in God and His messenger, and that you may support Him, honor Him, and glorify Him, morning and evening.</span>
<span class=verse id=s48v10 title="Surah 48, Verse 10">Those who pledge allegiance to you, are in fact pledging allegiance to God; the hand of God is above their hands. Those of them who violate such a pledge, are violating it only for themselves. And whoever fulfills what he has pledged to God, then He will grant him a great re ward.</span>
<span class=verse id=s48v11 title="Surah 48, Verse 11">The Nomads who lagged behind will say to you: "We were preoccupied with our money and our family, so ask forgiveness for us." They say with their tongues what is not in their hearts. Say: "Who then would possess any power for you against God if He wanted harm to afflict you or if He wanted benefit for you?" No, God is fully Aware of everything you do.</span>
<span class=verse id=s48v12 title="Surah 48, Verse 12">Alas, you thought that the messenger and the believers would not return to their families, and this was deemed pleasant in your hearts, and you thought the worst thoughts; you were a wicked people!</span>
<span class=verse id=s48v13 title="Surah 48, Verse 13">Anyone who does not believe in God and His messenger, then We have prepared for the rejecters a Fire.</span>
<span class=verse id=s48v14 title="Surah 48, Verse 14">And to God is the sovereignty of the heavens and the earth. He forgives whoever He wills, and punishes whoever He wills. God is Forgiver, Merciful.</span>
<span class=verse id=s48v15 title="Surah 48, Verse 15">Those who lagged behind will say, when you venture out to collect the spoils: "Let us follow you!" They want to change the words of God. Say: "You will not follow us; this is what God has decreed beforehand." They will then say: "No, you are envious of us." Alas, they rarely understood anything.</span>
<span class=verse id=s48v16 title="Surah 48, Verse 16">Say to those Nomads who lagged behind: "You will be called on to fight a people who are very powerful in warfare, unless they surrender. Then if you obey, God will grant you a good reward, but if you turn away as you turned away before, He will punish you with a painful retribution."</span>
<span class=verse id=s48v17 title="Surah 48, Verse 17">There is no burden on the blind, nor is there any burden on the cripple, nor is there any burden on the sick. And whoever obeys God and His messenger, He will admit them into gardens with rivers flowing beneath them; and whoever turns away, He will punish him with a painful retribution.</span>
<span class=verse id=s48v18 title="Surah 48, Verse 18">God is pleased with the believers who pledged allegiance to you under the tree. He knew what was in their hearts, so He sent down tranquility upon them, and rewarded them with a victory that is near.</span>
<span class=verse id=s48v19 title="Surah 48, Verse 19">And abundant spoils that they will take. God is Noble, Wise.</span>
<span class=verse id=s48v20 title="Surah 48, Verse 20">God has promised you abundant spoils that you will take. Thus He has hastened this for you, and He has withheld the hands of the people against you; that it may be a sign for the believers, and that He may guide you to a straight path.</span>
<span class=verse id=s48v21 title="Surah 48, Verse 21">And the other group which you could not vanquish, God took care of them. And God was capable of all things.</span>
<span class=verse id=s48v22 title="Surah 48, Verse 22">And if the rejecters had fought you, they would have turned and ran, then they would have found neither an ally nor a victor.</span>
<span class=verse id=s48v23 title="Surah 48, Verse 23">Such is the way of God with those who have passed away before, and you will not find any change in the way of God.</span>
<span class=verse id=s48v24 title="Surah 48, Verse 24">And He is the One who withheld their hands against you, and your hands against them in the interior of Mecca, after He had made you victorious over them. God is Seer of what you do.</span>
<span class=verse id=s48v25 title="Surah 48, Verse 25">They are the ones who rejected and barred you from the Restricted Temple, and barred your offerings from reaching their destination. And there had been believing men and believing women whom you did not know, and you may have hurt them, and on whose account you would have incurred a sin unknowingly. God will admit into His mercy whoever He wills. Had they become separated, We would then have punished those from them who rejected with a painful retribution.</span>
<span class=verse id=s48v26 title="Surah 48, Verse 26">Those who rejected had put in their hearts the rage of the days of ignorance. Then, God sent down tranquility upon His messenger and the believers, and directed them to uphold the word of righteousness, and they were well entitled to it and worthy of it. And God is fully aware of all things.</span>
<span class=verse id=s48v27 title="Surah 48, Verse 27">God has affirmed His messenger's vision to be the truth: "You will enter the Restricted Temple, God willing, secure, with your heads shaven and shortened, having no fear." Thus, He knew what you did not know, and He has appointed before this a conquest near at hand.</span>
<span class=verse id=s48v28 title="Surah 48, Verse 28">He is the One who sent His messenger with the guidance and the system of truth, so that it would expose all other systems. And God is enough as a witness.</span>
<span class=verse id=s48v29 title="Surah 48, Verse 29">Mohammed is the messenger of God, and those who are with him are severe against the rejecters, but merciful between themselves. You see them kneeling and prostrating, they seek the blessings and approval of God. Their distinction is in their faces, as a result of prostrating. Such is their example in the Torah. And their example in the Gospel is like a plant which shoots out and becomes strong and thick and it stands straight on its trunk, pleasing to the farmers. That He may enrage the rejecters with them. God promises those among them who believe and do good works a forgiveness and a great reward.</span>

<span class=verse id=s49v1 title="Surah 49, Verse 1">O you who believe, do not place your opinion above that of God and His messenger. And be aware of God. God is Hearer, Knowledgeable.</span>
<span class=verse id=s49v2 title="Surah 49, Verse 2">O you who believe, do not raise your voices above the voice of the prophet, nor shall you speak loudly to him as you would speak loudly to each other, lest your works become nullified while you do not perceive.</span>
<span class=verse id=s49v3 title="Surah 49, Verse 3">Surely, those who lower their voices with the messenger of God, they are the ones whose hearts have been tested by God for righteousness. They have deserved forgiveness and a great recompense.</span>
<span class=verse id=s49v4 title="Surah 49, Verse 4">Surely, those who call on you from behind the lodgings, most of them do not comprehend.</span>
<span class=verse id=s49v5 title="Surah 49, Verse 5">And if they had only been patient until you came out to them, it would have been better for them. God is Forgiver, Merciful.</span>
<span class=verse id=s49v6 title="Surah 49, Verse 6">O you who believe, if a wicked person comes to you with any news, then you shall investigate it. Lest you harm a people out of ignorance, then you will become regretful over what you have done.</span>
<span class=verse id=s49v7 title="Surah 49, Verse 7">And know that among you is the messenger of God. If he were to obey you in many things, you would have deviated. But God made you love faith and He adorned it in your hearts, and He made you hate disbelief, wickedness, and disobedience. These are the rightly guided ones.</span>

Once it complies, then you shall reconcile the two groups with justice, and be equitable; for God loves those who are equitable.</span>
<span class=verse id=s49v10 title="Surah 49, Verse 10">The believers are brothers; so reconcile between your brothers, and be aware of God, that you may receive mercy.</span>
<span class=verse id=s49v11 title="Surah 49, Verse 11">O you who believe, let not any people ridicule other people, for they may be better than they. Nor shall any women ridicule other women, for they may be better than they. Nor shall you mock one another, or call each other names; miserable indeed is the name of wickedness after attaining faith. And anyone who does not repent, then these are the transgressors.</span>
<span class=verse id=s49v12 title="Surah 49, Verse 12">O you who believe, you shall avoid much suspicion, for some suspicion is sinful. And do not spy on one another, nor shall you backbite. Would any of you enjoy eating the flesh of his dead brother? You certainly would hate this. You shall observe God. God is Redeemer, Merciful.</span>
<span class=verse id=s49v13 title="Surah 49, Verse 13">O people, We created you from a male and female, and We made you into nations and tribes, that you may know one another. Surely, the most honorable among you in the sight of God is the most righteous. God is Knowledgeable, Expert.</span>
<span class=verse id=s49v14 title="Surah 49, Verse 14">The Nomads said: "We believe." Say: "You have not believed; but you should say: 'We have submitted', for belief has not yet entered into your hearts." If you obey God and His messenger, He will not put any of your works to waste. God is Forgiver, Merciful.</span>
<span class=verse id=s49v15 title="Surah 49, Verse 15">Believers are those who believe in God and His messenger, then they became without doubt, and they strive with their money and their lives in the cause of God. These are the truthful ones.</span>
<span class=verse id=s49v16 title="Surah 49, Verse 16">Say: "Are you teaching God about your system while God knows everything in the heavens and the earth? God is knowledgeable of all things."</span>
<span class=verse id=s49v17 title="Surah 49, Verse 17">They think they are doing you a favor by having submitted! Say: "Do not think you are doing me any favors by your submission. For it is God who is doing you a favor that He has guided you to the faith, if you are being true."</span>
<span class=verse id=s49v18 title="Surah 49, Verse 18">Surely, God knows all the unseen in the heavens and the earth; God is Seer of what you do.</span>

And they should not be like those who were given the Book before, and the waiting became long for them, so their hearts became hardened, and many of them were wicked.</span>
<span class=verse id=s57v17 title="Surah 57, Verse 17">Know that God revives the land after it had died. We have made clear to you the signs, perhaps you may comprehend.</span>
<span class=verse id=s57v18 title="Surah 57, Verse 18">Surely, the charitable males and charitable females, who lend God a loan of righteousness, He will multiply their reward, and they will have a generous recompense.</span>
<span class=verse id=s57v19 title="Surah 57, Verse 19">And those who believed in God and His messengers are the truthful ones. And the martyrs at their Lord will have their reward and their light. As for those who disbelieved and denied Our revelations, they are the dwellers of Hell.</span>
<span class=verse id=s57v20 title="Surah 57, Verse 20">Know that the worldly life is no more than play and distraction and adornments, and boasting among you, and to increase in wealth and children. It is like plants that are supplied by an abundant rain, which appear pleasing to the rejecters. But then they dry up and turn yellow, and become useless hay. And in the Hereafter there is severe retribution, and forgiveness from God and acceptance. This worldly life is no more than a deceiving enjoyment.</span>
<span class=verse id=s57v21 title="Surah 57, Verse 21">You shall race towards forgiveness from your Lord, and a Paradise whose width is as the width of the heaven and the earth, prepared for those who believed in God and His messengers. Such is the grace of God that He bestows upon whoever He wills. God is the Possessor of Infinite Grace.</span>
<span class=verse id=s57v22 title="Surah 57, Verse 22">No misfortune can happen on the earth, or in yourselves, except it is decreed in a record, before We bring it about. This is easy for God to do.</span>
<span class=verse id=s57v23 title="Surah 57, Verse 23">In order that you do not despair over anything that has passed you by, nor be happy of anything He has bestowed upon you. God does not love those who are boastful, proud.</span>
<span class=verse id=s57v24 title="Surah 57, Verse 24">They are stingy, and order the people to be stingy. And for anyone who turns away, then know that God is the Rich, the Praiseworthy.</span>
<span class=verse id=s57v25 title="Surah 57, Verse 25">We have sent Our messengers with clear proofs, and We sent down with them the Book and the balance, so that the people may uphold justice. And We sent down the iron, wherein there is great strength, and many benefits for the people. So that God would distinguish those who would support Him and His messengers in the unseen. God is Powerful, Noble.</span>
<span class=verse id=s57v26 title="Surah 57, Verse 26">And We had sent Noah and Abraham, and We placed in their progeny the prophethood and the Book. Some of them were guided, while many were wicked.</span>
<span class=verse id=s57v27 title="Surah 57, Verse 27">Then We sent in their tracks Our messengers. And We sent Jesus, son of Mary, and We gave him the Gospel, and We ordained in the hearts of his followers kindness and mercy. But they invented Monasticism which We never decreed for them. They wanted to please God, but they did not observe it the way it should have been observed. Consequently, We gave those who believed among them their recompense, while many of them were wicked.</span>
<span class=verse id=s57v28 title="Surah 57, Verse 28">O you who believe, you shall reverence God and believe in His messenger. He will then grant you double the reward from His mercy, and He will make for you a light by which you shall walk, and He will forgive you. And God is Forgiving, Merciful.</span>
<span class=verse id=s57v29 title="Surah 57, Verse 29">So that the followers of the Book should know that they have no power over the grace of God, and that all grace is in the hand of God. He bestows it upon whoever He wills. God is Possessor of Infinite Grace.</span>

<span class=verse id=s58v2 title="Surah 58, Verse 2">Those among you who have estranged their women; they can never be made as their mothers, for their mothers are those who gave birth to them. Indeed, they are uttering what is strange and a falsehood. And God is Pardoner, Forgiver.</span>
<span class=verse id=s58v3 title="Surah 58, Verse 3">Those who had estranged their women, then they retracted what they had said, they shall free a slave before they have sexual contact between them. This is to enlighten you. God is well aware of everything you do.</span>
<span class=verse id=s58v4 title="Surah 58, Verse 4">If he cannot find any, then he shall fast two consecutive months before any sexual contact between them. If he cannot, then he shall feed sixty poor people. That is so you would believe in God and His messenger. And these are the boundaries set by God. The disbelievers have incurred a painful retribution.</span>
<span class=verse id=s58v5 title="Surah 58, Verse 5">Those who oppose God and His messenger will be disgraced, like their previous counterparts were disgraced. We have sent down clear proofs, and the rejecters have incurred a shameful retribution.</span>
<span class=verse id=s58v6 title="Surah 58, Verse 6">The Day when God resurrects them all, then He informs them of what they had done. God has recorded it, while they have forgotten it. God witnesses all things.</span>
<span class=verse id=s58v7 title="Surah 58, Verse 7">Do you not realize that God knows everything in the heavens and everything on the earth? No three people can meet secretly without Him being their fourth, nor five without Him being the sixth, nor less than that, nor more, without Him being there with them wherever they may be. Then, on the Day of Resurrection, He will inform them of everything they had done. God is fully aware of all things.</span>
<span class=verse id=s58v8 title="Surah 58, Verse 8">Have you noted those who were prohibited from holding meetings in secret, but then they go back to what they have been prohibited from? They meet secretly to commit sin, transgression, and disobedience of the messenger. When they come to you, they greet you with a greeting other than that which God greets you with. They say inside themselves: "Why does God not punish us for our utterances?" Hell will be sufficient for them, wherein they burn; what a miserable destiny.</span>
<span class=verse id=s58v9 title="Surah 58, Verse 9">O you who believe, if you must meet secretly, then you shall not meet to commit sin, transgression, and to disobey the messenger. You shall meet to work righteousness and piety. And be aware of God, before whom you will be summoned.</span>
<span class=verse id=s58v10 title="Surah 58, Verse 10">Secret meetings are from the devil, to cause grief to those who believed. However, he cannot harm them except if God wills. In God the believers shall put their trust.</span>

<span class=verse id=s58v12 title="Surah 58, Verse 12">O you who believe, if you wish to hold a private meeting with the messenger, you shall offer a charity before you do so. This is better for you, and purer. If you cannot do so, then God is Forgiver, Merciful.</span>
<span class=verse id=s58v13 title="Surah 58, Verse 13">Are you reluctant to offer a charity before such meeting? If you cannot do such, and God has forgiven you; then you shall hold the contact prayer, and contribute towards purification, and obey God and His messenger. God is fully Aware of everything you do.</span>
<span class=verse id=s58v14 title="Surah 58, Verse 14">Have you noted those who befriended people with whom God is angry? They are now neither from you nor from them. And they deliberately swear to lies while they know!</span>
<span class=verse id=s58v15 title="Surah 58, Verse 15">God has prepared for them a severe retribution. Miserable indeed is what they used to do.</span>
<span class=verse id=s58v16 title="Surah 58, Verse 16">They used their oaths as a means of repelling from the path of God. Consequently, they have incurred a shameful retribution.</span>
<span class=verse id=s58v17 title="Surah 58, Verse 17">Neither their money nor their children will avail them anything from God. These are the dwellers of the Fire, in it they will abide.</span>
<span class=verse id=s58v18 title="Surah 58, Verse 18">The Day will come when God resurrects them all. Then they will swear to Him, just as they swear to you, thinking that they are actually right! Indeed, they are the liars.</span>

<span class=verse id=s58v22 title="Surah 58, Verse 22">You will not find any people who believe in God and the Last Day leaning towards those who oppose God and His messenger, even if they were their parents, or their children, or their siblings, or their kin. For these, He decrees faith into their hearts, and supports them with a Spirit from Him, and He admits them into estates with rivers flowing beneath them; abiding therein. God is pleased with them, and they are pleased with Him. These are the party of God. Most assuredly, the party of God are the winners.</span>

<span class=verse id=s59v1 title="Surah 59, Verse 1">Glorifying God is everything in the heavens and the earth; and He is the Noble, the Wise.</span>
<span class=verse id=s59v2 title="Surah 59, Verse 2">He is the One who drove out those who disbelieved among the people of the Book from their homes at the very first mobilization. You never thought that they would leave, and they thought that their fortresses would protect them from God. But then God came to them from where they did not expect, and He cast terror into their hearts. They destroyed their homes with their own hands and the hands of the believers. So learn from this, O you who possess vision.</span>
<span class=verse id=s59v3 title="Surah 59, Verse 3">And had God not decreed to banish them He would have punished them in this world; and in the Hereafter they will face the retribution of the Fire.</span>
<span class=verse id=s59v4 title="Surah 59, Verse 4">This is because they challenged God and His messenger. And whoever challenges God, then God is severe in punishment.</span>
<span class=verse id=s59v5 title="Surah 59, Verse 5">Whether you cut down a tree or left it standing on its root, it was with the permission of God. He will surely humiliate the wicked.</span>
<span class=verse id=s59v6 title="Surah 59, Verse 6">And what God provided to His messenger, without you having to battle for it on horses or on foot, was because God sends His emissaries against whoever He wills. And God is capable of all things.</span>
<span class=verse id=s59v7 title="Surah 59, Verse 7">Whatever God bestowed upon His messenger from the people of the towns, then it shall be to God and His messenger, and the relatives, and the orphans, and the poor, and the wayfarer. Thus, it will not remain monopolized by the rich among you. And you may take what the messenger gives you, but do not take what he prohibits you from taking. And be aware of God, for God is mighty in retribution.</span>
<span class=verse id=s59v8 title="Surah 59, Verse 8">For the immigrants who are poor and were driven out of their homes and deprived of their properties; they were seeking a grace from God and acceptance, and they supported God and His messenger; these are the truthful ones.</span>
<span class=verse id=s59v9 title="Surah 59, Verse 9">And those who provided them with shelter, and were believers before them; they love those who immigrated to them, and they find no hesitation in their hearts in helping them, and they readily give them priority over themselves, even when they themselves need what they give away. Indeed, those who overcome their desires are the successful ones.</span>
<span class=verse id=s59v10 title="Surah 59, Verse 10">And those who came after them saying: "Our Lord, forgive us and our brothers who preceded us to the faith, and do not place in our hearts any animosity towards those who believed. Our Lord, You are Compassionate, Merciful."</span>
<span class=verse id=s59v11 title="Surah 59, Verse 11">Have you noted those who are hypocrites, they say to their brothers who have rejected among the people of the Book: "If you are driven out we will go out with you, and we will never obey anyone who opposes you. And if anyone fights you, we will support you." God bears witness that they are liars.</span>
<span class=verse id=s59v12 title="Surah 59, Verse 12">If they were driven out, they would not have gone out with them, and if anyone fought them, they would not have supported them. And even if they supported them, they would have turned around and fled. They could never win.</span>
<span class=verse id=s59v13 title="Surah 59, Verse 13">Indeed, you strike more terror in their hearts than their fear of God. This is because they are people who do not understand.</span>
<span class=verse id=s59v14 title="Surah 59, Verse 14">They will not fight you all together unless they are in fortified towns, or from behind walls. Their might appears formidable among themselves. You would think that they are united, but their hearts are divided. This is because they are people who do not comprehend.</span>
<span class=verse id=s59v15 title="Surah 59, Verse 15">Like the example of those who preceded them. They suffered the consequences of their decisions. They have incurred a painful retribution.</span>
<span class=verse id=s59v16 title="Surah 59, Verse 16">Like the example of the devil, when he says to man: "Reject," then as soon as he rejects, he says: "I am innocent of you. I fear God, Lord of the worlds."</span>
<span class=verse id=s59v17 title="Surah 59, Verse 17">So the destiny for both of them is the Fire, abiding therein. And such is the recompense for the wicked.</span>
<span class=verse id=s59v18 title="Surah 59, Verse 18">O you who believe, be aware of God, and let every soul examine what it has put forth for tomorrow. And be aware of God; for God is fully aware of everything you do.</span>
<span class=verse id=s59v19 title="Surah 59, Verse 19">And do not be like those who forgot God, so He made them forget themselves. These are the wicked.</span>
<span class=verse id=s59v20 title="Surah 59, Verse 20">Not equal are the dwellers of the Fire and the dwellers of Paradise; the dwellers of Paradise are the winners.</span>
<span class=verse id=s59v21 title="Surah 59, Verse 21">Had We sent down this Qur'an to a mountain, you would have seen it trembling, crumbling, out of concern from God. And such are the examples We put forth for the people, that they may reflect.</span>
<span class=verse id=s59v22 title="Surah 59, Verse 22">He is God; there is no other god besides Him. Knower of all secrets and declarations. He is the Almighty, the Merciful.</span>
<span class=verse id=s59v23 title="Surah 59, Verse 23">He is God; there is no other god besides Him. The King, the Holy, the Peace, the Faithful, the Supreme, the Noble, the Powerful, the Dignified. God be glorified; far above what they set up.</span>
<span class=verse id=s59v24 title="Surah 59, Verse 24">He is God; the Creator, the Initiator, the Designer. To Him belong the most beautiful names. Glorifying Him is everything in the heavens and the earth. He is the Noble, the Wise.</span>

<span class=verse id=s60v1 title="Surah 60, Verse 1">O you who believe, do not take My enemy and your enemy as allies. You extend love to them, even though they have rejected the truth that has come to you. They drive you and the messenger out, simply because you believe in God, your Lord. If you are mobilizing to strive in My cause, seeking My blessings, then how can you secretly love them? I am fully aware of everything you conceal and what you declare. And whoever of you does this, then he has gone astray from the right path.</span>
<span class=verse id=s60v2 title="Surah 60, Verse 2">If they encounter you, they treat you as enemies, and they extend their hands and tongues against you to hurt you. They desire that you reject.</span>
<span class=verse id=s60v3 title="Surah 60, Verse 3">Neither your relatives nor your children will benefit you; on the Day of Resurrection He will separate between you. And God is Seer of what you do.</span>
<span class=verse id=s60v4 title="Surah 60, Verse 4">There has been a good example set for you by Abraham and those with him, when they said to their people: "We are innocent from you and what you serve besides God. We have rejected you, and it appears that there shall be animosity and hatred between us and you until you believe in God alone." Except for the saying of Abraham to his father: "I will ask forgiveness for you, but I do not possess any power to protect you from God." "Our Lord, we have put our trust in You, and we turn to You, and to You is the final destiny."</span>
<span class=verse id=s60v5 title="Surah 60, Verse 5">"Our Lord, do not let us become a test for those who rejected, and forgive us. Our Lord, You are the Noble, the Wise."</span>
<span class=verse id=s60v6 title="Surah 60, Verse 6">Certainly, a good example has been set by them for those who seek God and the Last Day. And whoever turns away, then God is the Rich, the Praiseworthy.</span>
<span class=verse id=s60v7 title="Surah 60, Verse 7">Perhaps God will grant compassion between you and those you consider enemies; and God is Capable. And God is Forgiving, Merciful.</span>
<span class=verse id=s60v8 title="Surah 60, Verse 8">God does not prohibit you from those who have not fought you because of your system, nor drove you out of your homes, that you deal kindly and equitably with them. For God loves the equitable.</span>
<span class=verse id=s60v9 title="Surah 60, Verse 9">But God does prohibit you regarding those who fought you because of your system, and drove you out of your homes, and helped to drive you out. You shall not ally with them. Those who ally with them, then such are the transgressors.</span>
<span class=verse id=s60v10 title="Surah 60, Verse 10">O you who believe, if the believing females come emigrating to you, then you shall test them. God is fully aware of their belief. Thus, if you establish that they are believers, then you shall not return them to the rejecters. They are no longer lawful for one another. And return the dowries that were paid. And there is no sin upon you to marry them, if you have paid their dowries to them. And do not keep disbelieving wives, and ask back what dowries you paid. And let them ask back what dowries they had paid. Such is the judgment of God; He judges between you. God is Knowledgeable, Wise.</span>
<span class=verse id=s60v11 title="Surah 60, Verse 11">And if any of your wives have gone over to the camp of the rejecters, and you are granted victory over them, then you shall compensate those whose wives have gone over, to the equivalent of what dowry they spent. And be aware of God, in whom you believe.</span>
<span class=verse id=s60v12 title="Surah 60, Verse 12">O prophet, if the believing females come to make allegiance to you that they will not set up anything besides God, nor steal, nor commit adultery, nor kill their children, nor fabricate any falsehood, nor disobey you in any matter which is righteous, then you shall accept their allegiance, and ask God to forgive them. God is Forgiver, Merciful.</span>
<span class=verse id=s60v13 title="Surah 60, Verse 13">O you who believe, do not ally a people with whom God is angry; for they have given up regarding the Hereafter, just like the rejecters have given up on the people who are already in the graves.</span>

<span class=verse id=s63v7 title="Surah 63, Verse 7">They are the ones who say: "Do not spend on those who are with the messenger of God, unless they abandon him!" And to God belong the treasures of the heavens and the earth, but the hypocrites do not understand.</span>

<span class=verse id=s65v1 title="Surah 65, Verse 1">O prophet, if any of you have divorced the women, then they should be divorced while ensuring that their required interim is fulfilled, and keep count of the interim. You shall reverence God your Lord, and do not evict them from their homes, nor should they leave, unless they commit an evident immorality. And these are the boundaries of God. And anyone who transgresses the boundaries of God has wronged his soul. You never know; perhaps God will make something come out of this.</span>
<span class=verse id=s65v2 title="Surah 65, Verse 2">Then, once the interim is fulfilled, either you remain together equitably, or part ways equitably and have it witnessed by two just people from among you; and give the testimony for God. This is to enlighten those who believe in God and the Last Day. And whoever reverences God, He will create a solution for him.</span>
<span class=verse id=s65v3 title="Surah 65, Verse 3">And He will provide for him whence he never expected. Anyone who puts his trust in God, then He suffices him. The commands of God will be done. God has decreed for everything its fate.</span>
<span class=verse id=s65v4 title="Surah 65, Verse 4">As for those who have reached menopause from your women, if you have any doubts, their interim shall be three months-as well as for those who did not menstruate. And those who are already pregnant, their interim is until they give birth. And anyone who reverences God, He makes his matters easy for him.</span>
<span class=verse id=s65v5 title="Surah 65, Verse 5">This is the command of God that He sends down to you. And anyone who is aware of God, He will forgive his sins, and will improve his reward.</span>
<span class=verse id=s65v6 title="Surah 65, Verse 6">You shall let them reside in the dwelling you were in when you were together, and do not coerce them to make them leave. And if they are pregnant, you shall spend on them until they give birth. Then, if they nurse the infant, you shall give them their due payment. And you shall maintain the amicable relations between you. If you disagree, then another woman may nurse the child.</span>
<span class=verse id=s65v7 title="Surah 65, Verse 7">The rich shall provide support in accordance with his means, and the poor shall provide according to the means that God bestowed upon him. God does not burden any soul more than He has given it. God will provide ease after difficulty.</span>
<span class=verse id=s65v8 title="Surah 65, Verse 8">Many a town rebelled against the command of its Lord and His messengers. Thus, We called them to account severely, and We punished them a terrible punishment.</span>

<span class=verse id=s66v2 title="Surah 66, Verse 2">God has already given the law, regarding the cancellation of oaths. And God is your Lord, and He is the Knowledgeable, the Wise.</span>
<span class=verse id=s66v3 title="Surah 66, Verse 3">And when the prophet confided a narrative to some of his wives, then one of them spread it, and God revealed it to him, he recognized part of it and denied part. So when he informed her, she said: "Who informed you of this?" He said: "I was informed by the Knowledgeable, the Expert."</span>
<span class=verse id=s66v4 title="Surah 66, Verse 4">If the two of you repent to God, then your hearts have listened. But if you band together against him, then God is his ally, and so are Gabriel and the righteous believers. Also, the angels are his helpers.</span>

Their light will radiate around them and to their right. They will say: "Our Lord, keep perfect our light for us, and forgive us; You are able to do all things."</span>
<span class=verse id=s66v9 title="Surah 66, Verse 9">O prophet, strive against the rejecters and the hypocrites and be stern with them. Their abode is Hell, and a miserable destiny.</span>
<span class=verse id=s66v10 title="Surah 66, Verse 10">God puts forth as examples of those who have rejected, the wife of Noah and the wife of Lot. They were married to two of Our righteous servants, but they betrayed them and, consequently, they could not help them at all against God. And it was said: "Enter the Fire, both of you, with those who will enter it."</span>
<span class=verse id=s66v11 title="Surah 66, Verse 11">And God puts forth as an example of those who believed the wife of Pharaoh. She said: "My Lord, build a home for me near You in Paradise, and save me from Pharaoh and his works; and save me from the transgressing people."</span>
<span class=verse id=s66v12 title="Surah 66, Verse 12">And Mary, daughter of Imran, who maintained the chastity of her private part, so We blew into it from Our Spirit, and she believed in the words of her Lord and His Books; and she was of those who were devout.</span>
