[97:1] We have sent it down in the Night of Decree.
[97:2] And do you know what is the Night of Decree?
[97:3] The Night of Decree is better than one thousand months.
[97:4] The angels and the Spirit come down in it with the permission of their Lord to carry out every matter.
[97:5] It is peaceful until the coming of dawn.
