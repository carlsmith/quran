[101:0] In the name of God, the Almighty, the Merciful.

[101:1] The Calamity - [101:2] what is the Calamity? [101:3] What would convey
to you what the Calamity is? [101:4] A Day when people will be scattered like
clouds of moths, [101:5] and the mountains become like loose wool. [101:6] For
him whose balance is heavy: [101:7] He will have a pleasant life. [101:8] As
for him whose balance is light: [101:9] He will by cared for by the deepest
abyss. [101:10] And do you know what that implies? [101:11] It is an
inferno.
