[107:0] In the name of God, the Almighty, the Merciful.
[107:1] Have you seen he who is denying in the system?
[107:2] It is the one who mistreats the orphan,
[107:3] And the one who does not encourage the feeding of the poor.
[107:4] So woe to those who make the contact prayer,
[107:5] Who are towards their contact prayer absent minded.
[107:6] They only want to be seen,
[107:7] And they withhold from any assistance.
