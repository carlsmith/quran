[104:0] In the name of God, the Almighty, the Merciful.
[104:1] Woe to every backbiter, slanderer.
[104:2] Who gathered his wealth and counted it.
[104:3] He thinks that his wealth will make him immortal.
[104:4] Never! He will be thrown into the Destroyer.
[104:5] And do you know what is the Destroyer?
[104:6] The kindled Fire of God.
[104:7] Which reaches the inside of the hearts.
[104:8] It will confine them therein.
[104:9] In extended columns.
