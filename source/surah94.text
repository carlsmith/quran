[94:0] In the name of God, the Almighty, the Merciful.
[94:1] Did We not comfort your chest,
[94:2] And take from you your load,
[94:3] Which had put strain on your back?
[94:4] And We have raised your remembrance,
[94:5] So with hardship comes ease.
[94:6] With hardship comes ease.
[94:7] So when you are done, then stand.
[94:8] And to your Lord you shall seek.
