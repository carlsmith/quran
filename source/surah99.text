[99:0] In the name of God, the Almighty, the Merciful.
[99:1] When the earth rumbles and shakes.
[99:2] And the earth brings out its mass.
[99:3] And man will say: "What is wrong with her?"
[99:4] On that Day it will inform its news.
[99:5] That your Lord had inspired her to do so.
[99:6] On that Day, the people will be brought out in throngs to be shown their works.
[99:7] So whoever does the weight of an atom of good will see it.
[99:8] And whoever does the weight of an atom of evil will see it.
